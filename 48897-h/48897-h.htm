<h2 class="p4">PREFACE</h2>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap mid">My dear Boys; and particularly the Boy
Scouts</span>: As so much interest was displayed in my
book “<i>Famous Scouts</i>” and requests for more tales
were made by many of you, I have collected some
interesting stories of valiant and daring adventurers,
who were among the early settlers of the wilderness.
These men were real scouts and trappers, for they
lived in the wilds and had to know how to shoot a
rifle; how to trap; and how to camp in whatever place
night happened to overtake them. Savage men and
wild beasts were frequently encountered, and desperate
were the fights which these fellows engaged in.
Some of them lived to a happy and prosperous old
age; some perished from exposure, or by the hands
of their red enemies.</p>

<p>You, yourselves, are playing at scouting in cities,
in villages, and in a country which long since has been
populated by the whites. These hardy, old fellows
did not play at scouting, for it was their real existence,
and they had to know the game from boyhood. Their
deeds may seem to be atrocious and bloodthirsty, but
were they not surrounded by implacable enemies who
had no mercy upon them when they caught them unawares?</p>

<p>When I was in Harvard College our Professor of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
English&mdash;Dean LeBaron Russell Briggs&mdash;used to
advise us to “browse in the Library.” I followed his
advice in regard to these stories, and, after brushing
away the cobwebs from many a forgotten volume,
have been able to give you the accurate histories of
several important frontiersmen and heroes of the
border. These tales are all true and are vouched for
by early historians. All that I hope is that I have
served them up to you in a manner that is interesting
and is not dull. Believe me,</p>

<p class="pr8">Yours very affectionately,</p>
<p class="pr4"><span class="smcap lmid">Charles H. L. Johnston</span>.</p>

<h2 class="p4">THE FRONTIERSMAN</h2>

<p class="ppn4 p2">He stood ’neath the whispering pines, by his cabin,<br />
Lanky and gaunt, his face seamed and scarred,<br />
Knotted his hands and blackened with toiling,<br />
Bronzed well his face; his palms rough and hard.<br />
Strangely he gazed in the dim, filmy distance,<br />
Gazed, as the smoke from the fire curled and swayed,<br />
Rapt was his look, for a voice from the forest<br />
Spoke&mdash;and in accents disquieting&mdash;said:</p>

<p class="ppn4 p1"><i>Come! freeman! come! to the swirl of the river,<br />
Come! where the wild bison ranges and roams,<br />
Come! where the coyote and timber wolves whimper,<br />
Come! where the prairie dogs build their rough homes.<br />
Come to the hills where the blossoms are swaying,<br />
Come to the glades where the elk shrills his cry,<br />
Come&mdash;for the wild canyon echoes are saying,<br />
Come&mdash;only come&mdash;climb my peaks to the sky.</i></p>

<p class="ppn4 p1">A thrill shook the frame of the woodsman and trapper,<br />
A strange light of yearning came to his eye,<br />
Restless and roving by nature,&mdash;this wanderer,<br />
Shuddered and paled at the wild, hidden cry;<br />
Trembling he turned towards the hut in the shadow,<br />
Shaking he strode to the low, darkened door,<br />
Then stopped,&mdash;as sounded the voice from the meadow,<br />
Mutt’ring the challenge&mdash;o’er and o’er.</p>

<p class="ppn4 p1"><i>Come, will you come, where the brown ouzel nestles,<br />
Come, where the waterfall dashes and plays,<br />
Come, where the spike-horn rollicks and wrestles,<br />
On a carpet of moss, in the warm Autumn haze;<br />
The cloud banks are blowing o’er Leidy and Glenrock,<br />
On Wessex and Cassa the sun hides its head,<br />
Come, will you come, where the trout leaps in splendor,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>Come, only come, let the veldt be your bed.</i></p>

<p class="ppn4 p1">By the rough, oaken chair lay the grim, shining rifle,<br />
On a nail o’er the fire swung the curled powder-horn,<br />
With a smiling grimace he seized on these weapons,<br />
Wild emblems of conquest,&mdash;storm-battered and worn.<br />
“Stay,” whirred the loom, as it stood in the shadow,<br />
“Stay,” purred the cat, as it lay near the stove,<br />
“Stay where the woodbine and iris are trailing,<br />
Stay, only stay, calm this spirit to rove.”</p>

<p class="ppn4 p1"><i>But, “come” shrilled the voice on the dim, distant prairie,<br />
“Come, where the Cheyennes are roving and free,<br />
Where the beavers are damming the wild, rushing ice stream,<br />
Where the lean puma snarls in the shaggy, pine tree.<br />
Come&mdash;for the call of the wild is resounding,<br />
From Laramie’s peaks rolls the smoke of the fire.<br />
Lighted by scouts, where the herds are abounding,<br />
Fattened and sleek, for the red man’s desire.”</i></p>
<p class="ppn4"><span class="ls1">············</span></p>

<p class="ppn4 p1">Thus came the call, and thus trekked the plainsman,<br />
Westward, yet westward his grim step led on,<br />
By the wide, sedgy steppes, where the Platte curled and whispered,<br />
By the brackish salt lake, stretching gray ’neath the sun,<br />
Where the purple, red flowers in clusters lay glist’ning,<br />
Where the wild kestrel whirled o’er the precipice sheer,<br />
He conquered the wild, while the grizzly stood list’ning,<br />
And growled, as the white canvased wagons drew near.</p>

<p class="pc4 xlarge"><b>Famous Frontiersmen</b></p>
<p class="pc lmid">AND HEROES OF THE BORDER</p>

<p class="pc1">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<h2 class="p1">DANIEL MORGAN:</h2>

<p class="pch">THE FAMOUS VIRGINIAN RIFLEMAN, AND
HIS ADVENTURES WITH THE
INDIAN BEAR</p>

<p class="drop-cap03">DANIEL MORGAN was a famous Virginian
rifleman. As a young man he enlisted in the
French and Indian War, and joined an army
under Colonel St. Clair, who, as you remember, no
doubt, was so signally defeated by Little Turtle.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> The
bravery of St. Clair sometimes amounted to rashness.
His enemies have even accused him of indiscretion.
At any rate, when camped near the head waters of the
Mississippi, on the plains of the Chippewa, he placed
his men near a dense forest, in which his redskinned
enemies could easily pick off his sentinels without exposing
themselves, in the least, to danger from return
fire.</p>

<p>For five nights his army lay in this position, and
for five nights a sentinel was posted near the gloomy
borders of the forest. Alas! Every man who had held
the place was shot. This struck terror to the hearts
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>of the soldiers, and, when a sentinel was to be posted
upon the sixth night, no one would come forward to
take the position, without a serious protest. St. Clair
knew that it was only throwing away men’s lives to
place a sentinel in such an exposed situation, so he
insisted upon no one occupying it. This pleased his
followers mightily. “Colonel,” said many, “you are
a sensible man.”</p>

<p>Upon the evening of the sixth day, however, a rifleman
from the Virginia corps appeared before the Colonel’s
tent. His name was Daniel Morgan.</p>

<p>“Sir,” he remarked, saluting, “I feel that I can
take charge of this post. Put me there and see what
I can do.”</p>

<p>St. Clair looked at him dubiously.</p>

<p>“I think that you are rather rash,” said he. “But
you can have what you desire. Go, and good luck to
you, my son.”</p>

<p>Soon afterwards, the new guard marched up. The
scout fell in behind, shouldered his rifle, and went
forward.</p>

<p>“I’ll return safely,” said he, as he followed the leading
files. “And, Colonel St. Clair, I will drink your
health in the morning.”</p>

<p>The new guard marched on, arrived at the place
which had been so fatal to the sentries, and here
halted. Bidding his fellow soldiers “Good night,”
the sentry brought his gun to order arms and peered
about him. The night was a dark one. Thick clouds
overspread the heavens and hardly a star was to be
seen. Silence reigned, save for the beat of the retiring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
footsteps of the guard. The frontiersman paced
slowly up and down, then stopped, for in the far distance
came the cry of “All is well!”</p>

<p>Seating himself upon a fallen tree, the soldier fell
into a reverie, but, hark! what was that? A low,
rustling sound came from out the bushes. He gazed
intently towards the spot whence the noise seemed to
proceed, but he could see nothing but the impenetrable
gloom of the forest. Nearer and nearer came the
strange rustling and a well-known grunt informed
him that a large bear was approaching. Slowly the
animal came on&mdash;then quietly sought the thicket to
the left of his position.</p>

<p>At this particular moment the clouds drifted away
from the face of the moon, so that the soldier could
plainly see the lumbering brute. What was his surprise,
when he viewed a deer-skin legging and two
moccasined feet sticking out from the bottom of the
animal, where should have been two furry legs. He
could have shot the strange beast in a moment, but
he did not know how many other quadrupeds of a like
nature might be at hand. His fingers dropped from
his rifle trigger, and, taking off his hat and coat, he
hung them to the branch of a fallen tree, then silently
crept toward the thicket. Crouching low behind some
scrub bushes, he heard the twang of a low bow-string,
and an arrow, whizzing past his head, told him that he
had guessed correctly when he supposed that other
redskins were near by. A low murmur of voices came
from the bushes on the right.</p>

<p>The sentry gazed carefully about him. Pressing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
brush aside, he saw the form of a man, then of several
more. He counted their numbers and found that there
were twelve in all, some sitting, some lying full length
upon the thickly strewn leaves of the forest. Believing
that the whizzing arrow had laid the sentinel low,
and, little thinking that there was any one within hearing,
they conversed aloud about their plans for the
morrow.</p>

<p>“These men are few,” said one. “We will have
forty warriors ready in the evening. We will shoot
an arrow into the sentry, and then will attack the
camp.”</p>

<p>“Ugh! Ugh!” said another. “It will be easy to
overcome these palefaced warriors. This will be done.
There are but a few men who come out with the sentry,
and these we can readily take care of.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” said a third. “How pleasant it will be to
see the palefaces running homeward. It will be good.
It will be good.”</p>

<p>Eagerly the sentry scanned these men. He watched
them as they rose, and saw them draw the numerous
folds of their robes about them. He trembled, as they
marched off in single file through the forest, in order
to seek some distant spot, where the smoke of their
fire could not be seen by the whites, and where they
would not be followed, when the supposedly dead
sentry was found by his comrades. Then, rising from
his crouching position, the frontiersman returned to
his post. His hat had an arrow in it, and his coat was
pierced by two of them.</p>

<p>“By George,” said he, “I was lucky to escape.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>”
Wrapping himself in his long coat, he returned immediately
to the camp, and, without delay, demanded to
speak to Colonel St. Clair.</p>

<p>“I have something very important to say to Colonel
St. Clair,” said he, to the guard before his tent.</p>

<p>When the soldier reported his request, his commanding
officer ordered that he be immediately admitted
to his presence.</p>

<p>“You have done well,” remarked St. Clair, after
hearing his story. “Furthermore, I commission you
Lieutenant of the Virginia corps, to take the place of
your unfortunate comrade, Lieutenant Phipps, who
died three nights ago. You must be ready to-morrow
evening, with a picket guard, to march to the fatal
outpost, there to place your hat and coat upon the
branches, and then to lie in ambush for the intruders.”</p>

<p>“I shall be glad to carry out your commands,” replied
the newly appointed Lieutenant, smiling broadly.</p>

<p>According to order given out by Colonel St. Clair,
a detachment of forty riflemen, with Lieutenant Morgan
at their head, marched from the camp at half-past
seven on the following evening. Putting up a couple
of stakes, they arranged a hat and coat upon them so
as to resemble the appearance of a soldier standing on
guard, and then stole silently away in order to hide
in the bushes.</p>

<p>For an hour they lay quiet, intently listening for the
approach of the redskins. The night was cold and
still. A full moon shed its lustrous radiance over field
and forest. Snow was upon the ground, and becoming
chilled by contact with the cold sprinkling of fleecy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
white, some of the soldiers began to grumble quite
audibly.</p>

<p>“Silence!” whispered Lieutenant Morgan. “I
hear the rustling of leaves, and it is evident that either
a bear, or some red men are approaching.”</p>

<p>All crouched low and watched intently. Presently
a large, brown bear emerged from the thicket and
passed near the ambush.</p>

<p>“Hist!” whispered a soldier. “Look at his feet!”</p>

<p>Sure enough, moccasins were sticking out below.
The bear reconnoitered; saw the sentinel standing at
his post; retired into the forest for a few paces; then
rose and let fly an arrow which brought the make-believe
sentinel to the ground with a crash. The animal
stood there looking at his handiwork with interest.
So impatient were the Virginians to avenge the
death of their comrades, that they could scarcely wait
until the Lieutenant gave the word to fire. Then,
rising in a body, they let drive a volley. The bear
dropped instantly to the snow-covered ground, and a
number of red warriors, who had crept up behind him,
were also dispatched. Quickly loading, the frontiersmen
made a dash into the forest, again fired, and
killed, or wounded, several more of the enemy. They
then marched back to camp, highly pleased and elated
at their easy victory. Ten savages had fallen before
the deadly aim of their rifles, and there was wailing
and lamentation among the women of the Chippewa
nation.</p>

<p>But how about Lieutenant Morgan?</p>

<p>This doughty soldier rose to be a captain, and, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
the termination of the French and Indian campaign,
returned to his home, near Winchester, Virginia,
where he lived on his farm until the breaking out of
the War of the Revolution. Then, at the head of a
corps of Virginian riflemen, he attained great fame
and renown; was present at many an important battle,
and rendered signal service to the American cause.
But he never forgot the bear who walked with the
feet of a man.</p>

<h2 class="p4">JAMES HARROD:</h2>

<p class="pch">FOUNDER OF HARRODSBURG
KENTUCKY, AND FAMOUS SCOUT OF THE
FRONTIER</p>


<p class="drop-cap03">DANIEL BOONE&mdash;the founder of Kentucky&mdash;was
revered, respected, and admired by the
early pioneers. He was, as you know, a man
of much skill in woodcraft, and was also an unexcelled
rifle shot. Another early settler of this border
state was James Harrod, of whom we have but little
record, for he was a lover of solitude and his expeditions
into the wilderness were usually taken alone.
Furthermore, he was the most modest of men and
never wrote or spoke of his own deeds. A little
knowledge of his adventures, however, has come down
to us, and we are sure that he was one of the bravest
of the brave. To a noble courage was added a great
gentleness of manner which, in another, might almost
be called effeminacy.</p>

     <div class="caption"><p class="pc">JAMES HARROD.</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>What drove this valiant soul into the wilderness of
Kentucky? What spirit moved his restless footsteps
into the virgin forest? How came he to penetrate into
that “dark and bloody ground?” Who knows? His
was the restless spirit and his was the soul which loved
the vast solitude of the wildwood; for&mdash;even earlier
than Daniel Boone&mdash;we know that this sinewy frontiersman
built a log cabin for himself at the present
site of Harrodsburg. When Boone went to the assistance
of the surveyors of Lord Dunmore, who were
surrounded by the red men, Harrod returned to Virginia
and joined a force of whites sent to repel the
Shawnees and other savages at Point Pleasant on the
Great Kanawha. He was under General Lewis in the
bloody affair, and then, having done his duty by his
white brethren, returned to Kentucky in order to make
Harrodsburg a place of refuge for the immigrants,
who were beginning to turn their steps towards the
setting sun.</p>

<p>One day, as he sat before his cabin busily engaged
in cleaning his rifle, a man ran up to him. He was
plainly excited, and was breathing heavily, as if laboring
under a severe mental strain.</p>

<p>“Bad news, comrade!” said he, when he had
partly recovered his breath. “Jim Bailey’s cabin has
been attacked by the red men and no one is alive to tell
the tale, save his two daughters, who have been carried
away by the savages in the direction of their village.
Unless a party hurries immediately in pursuit,
they will be taken to the tribe and will be never seen
again. Their fate will not be a pleasant one.”</p>

<p>The frontiersman jumped to his feet immediately.</p>

<p>“I will go at once,” said he. “You warn the other
settlers and send all that you can after me. Now, there
is no time to be lost!”</p>

<p>Seizing his powder-horn and pouch of bullets, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
was soon speeding through the forest. He knew well
where the cabin lay, and, as he burst through the tangled
woodland, saw that a terrific fight had occurred
around the little log fortress in the wilderness. Smoke
still came from the chimney. The windows were battered
and broken. The door was a splintered wreck.
And, as he gazed inside, he saw the evil work of the
vindictive redskins. The tracks of the murderers were
plain, for a rain had fallen and it was evident that
eight or ten had been in the party.</p>

<p>“Curses upon you, Shawnees!” cried Harrod, in
loud tones. “You will pay for this ere many days
are o’er!”</p>

<p>It was near midday. The scout took one lingering
glance at the wreckage of that once peaceful home,
then turned and followed the trail of the savages. It
was clear, and he saw&mdash;after an hour’s travel&mdash;that
the Indians had separated. One half had gone toward
the Indian towns. One half had sheered off toward
a settlement, about fifteen miles below. Presuming
that the Indians would take the girls to the settlement
by the nearest route, he followed the first trail, and,
as night came on, was delighted to see a camp-fire
before him, in the dense woodland.</p>

<p>With true woodsman’s cunning, the scout dropped
to his knees and cautiously wormed a way toward
the glimmering embers. Peeping over a fallen log,
he saw that there were five Indians lying near the
blaze. His heart now beat tumultuously&mdash;for there,
also, were the two captive girls. They were bound
with deer thongs, and, even at that distance, he could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
mark the misery expressed upon their pale countenances.</p>

<p>It was too early for the lone woodsman to attempt
to make an attack. With the courage of a lion he intended
to do this single-handed. You think it a hazardous
adventure, no doubt? Wait, and see how he
fared!</p>

<p>Creeping to a large oak, he put his back against it
and went to sleep “with one eye open,” as the hunters
call it. He slumbered peacefully until about twelve
o’clock&mdash;then rose and again wriggled towards the
fire in order to see how matters stood. All the
savages were lying down, save one, who seemed to
be keeping guard over the others. But even he
was sleepy. His head nodded drowsily upon his
breast.</p>

<p>The scout watched him intently, while his right
hand grasped his tomahawk. The savage seated himself,
then got up, yawned, and lay down by the side
of his companions. Harrod saw his opportunity, and,
leaning his rifle against a tree, began to crawl towards
the camp.</p>

<p>You can be well assured that the seasoned frontiersman
made little noise as he did so. But he was suddenly
forced to stop. The Indian sentinel arose,
stretched himself, and walked towards the place where
the scout lay prostrate upon some green moss. Every
nerve in the Kentuckian was a-quiver. He was all
prepared to make one desperate leap upon the foe.
But, as he was about to spring upward, the Indian
turned back and lay down.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>The avenger of Jim Bailey’s family now began to
crawl towards the camp. Luck was not with him. A
stick snapped beneath his left hand, and, as it cracked
like the report of a pistol, the Shawnee sentinel sprang
hastily to his feet. Looking furtively around, he
stirred the fire and squatted down beside it. Harrod,
meanwhile, crouched close to the moist earth, praying&mdash;beneath
his breath&mdash;that the Indian would again
lie down. Minute after minute passed. The redskin
still stirred the embers with a long twig, and, fearing
that day would break before he would accomplish his
object, the bold pioneer began to retreat towards the
tree where he had left his rifle. As he wormed his
way backwards, he saw the guard stretch himself out
by the side of his companions. The scout breathed
easier.</p>

<p>Reaching the tree where his rifle stood, he took it
up, and again began his cautious wriggle towards the
fire. This time luck was with him, for he crept right
up to the side of the sleeping savages.</p>

<p>Lest you think I am exaggerating this affair, I will
here quote an authentic historian. He says: “To
draw his tomahawk and brain two of the sleeping Indians
was but the work of a moment, and, as he was
about to strike the third one, the handle turned in his
fingers, and the savage received the blow on the side
instead of the centre of his head. He awoke with a
yell. It was his last. Grasping his weapon more
firmly, the frontiersman struck the fellow a surer
blow and dropped him lifeless to the ground. With
a terrific whoop he now sprang for his rifle just as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
the two other Indians rose to escape, and, firing hastily,
one of them fell to rise no more.”</p>

<p>The other red man scampered into the forest as
fast as his sinewy legs could carry him. The scout
was after him as hard as he, too, could go, but the
savage could run like a deer and proved to be too fleet
for the trapper. Harrod stopped, and, taking careful
aim, threw his tomahawk at his enemy. So sure was
his missile hurled that it lopped off one of the Indian’s
ears and cut a deep gash in his cheek. In spite of the
grievous wound the savage did not halt, but bounded
away like a Virginian deer. Harrod stood for a
while, laughing at the running brave, then slowly
turned and made his way back to camp. Here he
found the two captive girls, crying bitterly. He unbound
them, received their joyous thanks, was embraced
by both; and then took them upon the trail
to the settlement. Imagine the joy of the frontiersmen
when they saw them return, and, although a party
had started out to track the Indians, they had only
travelled about three miles from Harrodsburg when
they met the triumphant pioneer.</p>

<p>“Hurrah! Hurrah for Harrod!” they shouted.
“You are indeed a worthy scout! Hurrah! Hurrah!”</p>

<p>The two girls were carried upon the men’s shoulders
into camp, and there were given a feast of welcome.
They were embraced by the women, hugged by the
children, and were presented with a wreath of flowers
by the men. As for Harrod, his modesty forbade him
taking part in the ceremonies, and, leaving the next<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
day upon a hunting excursion, he was not heard or
seen until a week later, when he returned with several
deer and bear skins.</p>

<p>Shortly after this thrilling adventure the scout went
into the forest in search of game. Not far from the
settlement he spied a fat deer. He drew a careful
bead on him, and was just about to raise his rifle for
a shot when he heard the buck whistle and saw him
raise his head. He knew from this that the forest
rover had scented some hidden foe, and, sure that it
was not himself that the animal smelled&mdash;as the wind
was blowing from the deer toward him&mdash;he crouched
down to await developments. He had not long to
remain in this position. In a few moments he heard
the crack of a rifle and saw the noble buck leap high
into the air. He fell prone upon his side, and, as he
lay quivering in the grass, three Indians came up and
began to skin him. They were laughing and talking
in loud tones.</p>

<p>“Ah ha,” said the scout to himself, “they are skinning
my game for me. Let them go on.”</p>

<p>He crouched low in the brush, and when they had
about completed this operation he rose, took careful
aim, and killed the one he judged to be the leader of
the party. Believing that he was too well concealed
to be detected, he crouched behind the brush, and,
turning his back, reloaded his rifle in that position.
The redskins, meanwhile, climbed into some trees, but
one of them exposed himself to the keen view of the
scout. Harrod took careful aim, and, at the discharge
of his flint-lock, the savage tumbled to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
ground. The third Indian now saw where he was
concealed, and, leaping to the ground, made at him
with rifle raised. Harrod put his cap upon a stick
and poked it above the brush. The redskin fired,
thinking that he was aiming at the trapper, and, as his
bullet whistled by the head of the man of the frontier,
the scout knew that the advantage was now on his side.
Drawing his tomahawk, he leaped from his hiding
place, and, in a few bounds, had swung his weapon
above the head of the now terrified brave. In a second
it was all over with the red man.</p>

<p>The scout sat down and laughed loudly, for he had
won a glorious victory. Then he rose, gathered up
the arms of his enemies, loaded himself with deer
meat, and made his way back to his cabin. He was
well satisfied with the day’s work.</p>

<p>This was but one of many adventures. He continued
upon his solitary hunts, and, while searching for
game, often was surrounded by roving Shawnees, so
that his life was in constant danger.</p>

<p>A month after the first affair he was chasing some
deer on Cedar Run&mdash;a tributary of a stream now
named Harrod’s Creek, in honor of this intrepid pioneer.
He had shot a fat buck and was bending over
him in order to get the choicest bit of venison, when
a bullet whizzed suddenly by his ear. A loud and
triumphant yell sounded in the forest at the same instant,
and, looking up, he saw that he was confronted
by a dozen red men. His only safety was in flight.</p>

<p>Scout Harrod was no mean runner. Inured to
hardship, and with muscles of steel, he bounded away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
like one of the very deer which he had just dispatched.
The Indians were in hot pursuit. As they came on,
their leader cried, at the top of his voice:</p>

<p>“Come on! Here is the lone panther&mdash;Come on!
Come on!”</p>

<p>So hotly did they push the running trapper that
Harrod did not keep a proper lookout for what was
in front of him. To his dismay, he found that he
almost ran into a party of savages coming up to join
the others. What was he to do? In a moment he had
made up his mind.</p>

<p>Dashing right up to the oncoming braves he began
to yell at the top of his lungs: “Come on, boys&mdash;here
they are&mdash;Come on! Come!” He then followed
this with an exultant whoop.</p>

<p>The Shawnees could not see their friends,&mdash;the
pursuers. They were therefore of the opinion that
this was a war party of whites, in considerable numbers,
which is just what Harrod wished them to believe.
Those in front became panic stricken, and
turned without firing a shot. Those in the rear followed,
while Harrod&mdash;racing after them&mdash;struck
two to the earth with his tomahawk. One was a celebrated
Shawnee chief, called Turkey Head, who was
noted for his cruelty to the unlucky settlers who fell
into his hands.</p>

<p>The scout kept on, plunged into a ravine, and seated
himself in some thick brush. Peeping through the
leaves, he saw his pursuers go on in full cry. Their
wild yelping finally died out in the distance, and, turning
around, the famous woodsman retraced his steps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
towards the settlement. He arrived there in due time,
much overjoyed to have thus safely escaped from his
vindictive enemies.</p>

<p>This was certainly a narrow escape, but another
adventure&mdash;some days later&mdash;was about as thrilling
as the last.</p>

<p>While at Harrodsburg he learned that a marauding
expedition was about to start for the settlements, led
by a famous warrior called Turtle Heart. He must
stop it if he could, but, should he know their plans it
would be far easier to head off the wild band, which
would fall upon the log houses of the pioneers like a
cloud of fire.</p>

<p>The scout set off alone in order to visit the Indian
town, and, reaching it about noon, secreted himself
upon an eminence from which he could watch the
gathering savages. Here he lay until nightfall, then&mdash;carefully
hiding his gun&mdash;stole noiselessly into the
town and approached the council house. Worming
his way up to it, he crouched near a hole&mdash;looked
through&mdash;and saw many of the chiefs in close consultation.</p>

<p>“We will attack in two days,” said one big, fierce-looking
fellow. “The palefaces shall not possess the
land given to us by the Great Father.”</p>

<p>“Ugh! Ugh!” uttered several. “The palefaces
must go home to the land of the rising sun!”</p>

<p>This was enough for the scout, and, rising, he began
to beat a retreat. Suddenly he started back, for before
him stood a giant redskin who seized him by the
shoulder. Harrod saw that he was about to give a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
whoop of alarm. There was not a moment to be lost.
Catching the warrior fiercely by the throat, the pioneer
stunned him by a terrific blow of the fist. So
strong was he that he broke the neck of the brave,
and, without waiting an instant, bounded forth into
the darkness. A single cry, or even the sound of a
struggle, would have brought a hundred infuriated
savages to the scene. His nerve and gigantic strength
had saved him from an awful death.</p>

<p>Not many weeks after this affair he married a
young and beautiful girl, was given a Colonel’s commission
for his many services upon the frontier, and
retired to the peace and seclusion of a small log hut
near the town which he had founded. But his charming
wife could not prevent his long and solitary excursions
into the wilderness, where were deer, bear, wild
turkeys, and lurking redskins. One day he went upon
one of these hazardous trips, and from it he never
returned. Parties of friendly pioneers scoured the
woods in every direction, but he had “gone on and
had left no sign.” No trace of this gallant scout was
ever found&mdash;no word of him ever came from woodsman
or savage. Whether he met his end in manly
combat, or whether he was tortured at the stake, no
tongue could tell. His fate is wrapped in impenetrable
mystery, and the silence of the forest broods over
the spirit of James Harrod; frontiersman, pioneer,
and hardy woodland adventurer.</p>

<h2 class="p4">ROBERT McLELLAN:</h2>

<p class="pch">PLUCKIEST OF THE EARLY PIONEERS</p>

<p class="drop-cap01">WHEN “Mad Anthony” Wayne was furiously
battling with Little Turtle at Fallen Timbers,
a daring adventurer was with him who
was subsequently to play a most important part in the
exploration of the then unconquered and unexplored
West. Hardy, utterly fearless, and possessed of wonderful
agility,&mdash;such was Robert McLellan, one of
the most noted scouts that ever operated upon the
border, and a rifleman whose aim was both quick
and marvellously true.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1794 the celebrated “Mad Anthony”
was pushing his way into the Indian country
and was most desirous of securing a red prisoner,
so that he could learn the force and strength of his
savage opponents. Calling McLellan to him, he said:</p>

<p>“Bob, I wish you to take two trusty companions&mdash;Miller
and Wells will do&mdash;and leave to-night for
the Shawnee country. Secure a prisoner, as soon as
possible, and return to camp with the fellow alive,
for I am extremely anxious to get information in
regard to the whereabouts of the large force of redskins
which I know to be in my front.”</p>

<p>McLellan was delighted.</p>

<p>“All right, Captain,” he replied with enthusiasm.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
“You leave the matter to me and I will guarantee
that I and my friends will return with the desired
captive. Only give us time and we will deliver the
man of the woods, right side up and with care.”</p>

<p>The General laughed.</p>

<p>“Very good,” said he. “Go in, now, and win
out.”</p>

<p>Next morning McLellan and his two companions
started forth with confidence and were soon far in
the hostile country, where many prints of moccasined
feet warned them that the savages were in the vicinity.
One day they followed a fresh trail, and, upon peering
around a projecting clump of bushes, saw three savages
sitting upon a log near a great fire, at which they
were cooking some venison. They crawled softly
towards them, and decided, in a whispered consultation,
that Wells should shoot the redskin upon the left;
Miller, the one upon the right; and that McLellan,
leaving his rifle against a tree, should run the other
fellow down and capture him.</p>

<p>At the given signal the rifles spoke in unison, and
the two redskins who had been marked, fell prostrate
to the earth; for both of the pioneers could hit the
eye of a squirrel at fifty yards. The one in the centre
leaped swiftly to his feet, and, darting through
the thicket, was soon bounding away to safety. But
McLellan was after him in a jiffy, and the redskin
realized that he was running away from one of the
speediest frontiersmen in all Ohio. On, on, they
rushed, but, seeing that he was being rapidly overtaken,
the savage turned in his course, headed for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
stream, and, with one furtive glance at the oncoming
man in buckskin, leaped from the high bank into the
eddying current.</p>

<p>Raising his tomahawk in his right hand, the trapper
made the venturesome leap with quite as much
readiness as his opponent, and landed with a resounding
splash. The water was very shallow in this spot.
To his disgust, he found himself stuck up to the waist
in the heavy mud. The redskin, too, was mired, but,
brandishing a long knife aloft, now endeavored to
strike it into McLellan’s body.</p>

<p>He was dealing with a crafty antagonist who had
parried many a knife-thrust before, and, quick as a
flash, the pioneer grabbed the right arm of the Shawnee.
In an instant his tomahawk was raised as if
to brain the red man, who cried, “Ugh! Ugh! Paleface,
you too strong. I surrender.”</p>

<p>In a moment more the other two pioneers had
reached the bank, and, leaning over the edge, pulled
both savage and frontiersman out of the mud. Each
was vigorously washed. To the surprise of all, the
redskin was discovered to be a white man; the brother
of Trapper Miller, himself, who had been captured by
the savages when young, and had preferred to remain
with them, although his kinsman had early left and
had returned to his own people. “Ugh! Ugh!” he
muttered. “I hate all of you.”</p>

<p>In spite of his protestations he was taken to the
headquarters of “Mad Anthony;” was confined to
the guard-house; and was questioned very closely in
regard to the numbers of his Shawnee allies. He was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
extremely moody and resisted all attempts at conciliation,
even from his brother, but at last some memory
of his former relatives seemed to return; he began
to grow more amiable; and, joining the company
captained by a noted Ranger, served in the ranks of
the whites against the people of his adoption.</p>

<p>So much for the ability to run, which was exhibited
by this celebrated woodsman. Marvellous feats of
strength and agility are also told of McLellan.
Amongst other stories, it is related that one day, in
Lexington, Kentucky, a yoke of oxen blocked the narrow
street down which he was going, so that it was
impossible to pass on either side. Instead of turning
out of the way, or waiting for the team to move on,
the famous man of the frontier made a few rapid
bounds, and&mdash;with a mighty spring&mdash;cleared both
of the oxen with the greatest possible ease.</p>

<p>Another yarn is also narrated concerning his wonderful
ability to jump, for it is said that he was
excelled only by one William Kennan, a Kentuckian,
and noted scout of the border. It is currently reported,
and a historian of the period quotes two unimpeachable
witnesses to back his statement, that at a
trial of strength and agility with several other scouts,
McLellan was asked if he could leap over a covered
wagon.</p>

<p>“I feel like a colt,” he is said to have replied, “and,
if you will but watch me, I am sure that I can clear
this obstacle. Now, boys, look at me!”</p>

<p>With a run, a short step, and a tremendous spring,
the trapper shot into the air, and&mdash;to the astonishment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
of all&mdash;lighted softly upon the ground, on the
other side of the wagon. He had leaped over an obstacle
at least eight and a half feet high, is reported
by an old chronicler of these early days, but this is
hardly possible in view of the fact that the world’s
record for the high jump is but six feet nine inches.
At any rate, he had made an extraordinary performance.</p>

<p>In the year 1806, the famous adventurer Meriwether
Clark met Robert McLellan ascending the
swift and muddy waters of the Missouri in a canoe.
Clark was returning from his long and dangerous
expedition up the Mississippi and to the Pacific coast,
which he had taken with Lewis (“the undaunted
one”). Accompanying the valiant McLellan were
numerous companions; all of the same hardy stamp
as their leader, and all bent upon trading with the
redskins.</p>

<p>“Where are you bound?” asked Clark.</p>

<p>“To fix up a trading post,” answered McLellan,
“where I can meet the red varmints on equal terms,
trade with ’em, and get rich.”</p>

<p>Clark smiled dubiously.</p>

<p>“You’ll have a hard time,” he answered, “for the
French and Spanish are very jealous of you English.
They operate mainly from St. Louis, and are endeavoring
to monopolize the entire trade of this western
country.”</p>

<p>“Well,” answered McLellan, with some show of
anger, “I intend to hold this place against all the
frog and garlic eaters in creation. Let them try to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
force out Robert McLellan, an’ there’ll be as tough
a fight as any man ever looked for.”</p>

<p>From his former acquaintance with this trapper,
Clark fully believed that any attempt on the part of
the rival traders to drive him from the ground would
certainly result in a sharp and bloody battle.</p>

<p>“These French and Spanish traders,” continued
McLellan, “are like a dog who has had far too much
to eat, and who is determined not to allow any of his
fellows to share in the viands which he has before
him. They want it all.”</p>

<p>Clark could not help laughing.</p>

<p>“Look out for these Indians around here,” said he.
“They are treacherous devils and will betray you
when you least expect it.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be on my guard,” McLellan replied.</p>

<p>The explorer now gave him valuable information
in connection with the various tribes of Indians who
occupied the ground adjacent to the banks of the
river. He again warned him of their treacherous
character, but felt more at ease when he learned that
his old-time friend had recently been an Indian trader
for some time upon the frontier. Parting company
at this point, the two hardy pioneers were destined
never to see each other again, for Clark turned
towards the peaceful East, while McLellan faced
towards the savage frontier, where lay danger, toil,
and thrilling adventures.</p>

<p>Pushing up the turbid waters of the Missouri, the
hardy scout soon saw that his progress was not going
to be any too easy. Suddenly hundreds of red men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
crowded the steep bluffs, which jutted high above the
sides of the narrow stream, and brandished their
spears and tomahawks in the faces of the whites.
There were but forty trappers, so it could be plainly
seen that it was wisest to submit to the demands
of the hostiles. A solitary chieftain&mdash;splendidly
mounted&mdash;now dashed up to the bank and held up
his hand in token of a parley.</p>

<p>“Ugh! Ugh! Palefaces,” said he, “you cannot
come further into our country, for you will drive off
all the game and we desire it for ourselves. But, if
you want to build big house for trading you can do
so down the stream.”</p>

<p>“I reckon they’ve got us, boys,” said McLellan.
“We’ll retreat and put up our tent lower down. I’ll
guarantee that this hold-up didn’t originate with the
redskins. There’s Spanish blood behind this affair,
or else my name’s not Robert McLellan.”</p>

<p>The savages supposed that the whites were perfectly
contented with this enforced arrangement, and
drew off, leaving a guard to watch the traders. But
McLellan was a past master in outwitting Indians
and had fooled too many in former years. No sooner
had the army of savages moved well towards their
villages than he hastily loaded up his boat, and, by
pulling it very rapidly, passed the cliffs, where the red
men had held him up before. He soon reached a spot
suitable for his establishment, there built several log
huts, and prepared to spend a considerable time in
peaceful trading. He also swore to have revenge
upon a Spaniard, called Manuel Lisa, as soon as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
could catch him. For he learned that this opposition
trader had been the cause of his detention.</p>

<p>McLellan lived here for several years in partnership
with an adventurous borderer named Crooks,
who was an expert in trading with the savages. They
prospered, but soon the Sioux grew very troublesome.
One day, when the trappers were off on a hunt, the
red men surrounded the post, overpowered the trappers
left behind, and began to carry off all of the
valuable stores. McLellan returned before the work
of spoliation was quite completed and burst in among
the savages, exhibiting terrific anger.</p>

<p>“You curs!” he shouted, “bring back everything
that you have taken away, or I’ll blow you all to
pieces with my cannon!”</p>

<p>The Sioux well knew the ungovernable temper and
desperate character of the infuriated trapper.</p>

<p>“He heap angry!” said they. “We do as he say.”</p>

<p>They returned much that had been taken away, but
much that had been carried to the Indian village never
came back, and the valorous trader had to pocket a
loss of about three thousand dollars. Heaping curses
upon the heads of the savages, the Spaniards, the
Frenchmen, and all the other “unmitigated rascals,”
as he called them, the outraged trader now fitted up
his boats and started down the Missouri River to
engage in business at a place where his competitors
would be more honest and honorable.</p>

<p>Crooks had parted company with McLellan some
time before this outrage.</p>

<p>“I can do better for myself down stream,” he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
said. “The Indians here are too troublesome, for
they are under the influence of the rascally Spaniard,
Manuel Lisa.”</p>

<p>What was the surprise of the disappointed frontiersman,
when floating down the Missouri on his
way to St. Louis, to find his former partner at the
mouth of the Nodaway River.</p>

<p>“I’m delighted to see you, Crooks,” he cried, and,
rounding to, he ran his canoe upon the bank. While
their men mingled together the partners had a long
conversation, and from Crooks it was learned that
the organization, with which he was now connected,
was under the command of a Mr. Hunt&mdash;one of John
Jacob Astor’s partners in the American Fur Company.</p>

<p>“We are bound for the mouth of the Columbia
River,” said Crooks, “where we are to meet another
part of the expedition which has gone by sea. We
will be camped here until spring, so will you not join
us? I am sure that you will have better luck in trading
and trapping in this new field.”</p>

<p>McLellan could not withstand the temptation.</p>

<p>“By George,” cried he, “I’ll be with you. I’ll
begin a new life and see if I cannot have better success
than here upon the Missouri.”</p>

<p>Throwing away all of his worldly possessions, except
his trusty rifle, the unfortunate trader joined the
expedition.</p>

<p>“I am determined to begin the world anew,” he
wrote to his brother. “And I trust that there will be
no Spanish traders in the country to which we are
going.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>His hopes were in vain, for they heard that Manuel
Lisa was on the way to impede their progress and
would use every effort to pass them by and prevent
them from gaining any trade benefits with the Indians
above. Sure enough, an emissary soon appeared from
the crafty Spaniard, holding a message in his hand.</p>

<p>“If you wait for my party,” it ran, “we can enter
this territory together and share the trade. This will
be better for all concerned.”</p>

<p>“Don’t give in to him,” cried McLellan, when he
heard this message. “The lying Spaniard can’t tell
the truth if he tries to, and cannot be honest if he
wishes. He’ll trick you after he has made you believe
that he is your friend.”</p>

<p>“I believe that you’re right,” Hunt answered.
“I’ll send him no definite reply.”</p>

<p>So he returned a missive which did not commit him
to any particular course of procedure.</p>

<p>In a few days&mdash;it was the thirty-first of May&mdash;immense
bodies of savages gathered on the bluffs of
the river, armed and painted for war. They screeched
their defiance and yelled like demons, so it was easy
to see that the tricky Manuel had been influencing
them. Every trapper seized his arms and stood ready
for action.</p>

<p>“Load up the artillery!” cried Captain Hunt, for
he saw that it was dangerous both to retreat and to
advance. “We will first fire off some blank cartridges
and see if we cannot scare these pesky varmints into
submission.”</p>

<p>In a few moments smoke and flame burst from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
mouths of the cannon and the redskins beat a precipitate
retreat. But soon they gathered again and made
peace signs.</p>

<p>“We would make big talk,” cried one painted brave.
“We love our white brothers.”</p>

<p>“Load the cannon with grape and cannister,” said
McLellan to his men. “Hunt and I will go ashore,
and, if the redskins show any signs of treachery,
blaze away.”</p>

<p>His men smiled, as the daring trapper now approached
the bank, where the Indians welcomed him
with much show of good will, for they saw that the
white men meant business. They smoked the pipe
of peace together, and, finding that the trappers were
determined to advance at any cost, the red men suddenly
evinced a perfect willingness to allow them to
go on. Their hearts were warmed by the gift of
several hundredweight of corn, and&mdash;what they
loved still more&mdash;a quantity of tobacco. “Ugh!
Ugh!” grunted the chiefs. “We love our white
brothers.”</p>

<p>Seeing that the red men were now peaceful, McLellan
ordered his own followers to advance up the
river, but he was soon surprised by seeing another
band of Indians, who rode along the bank of the
stream but seemed to be friendly.</p>

<p>“By George!” cried McLellan, “these fellows are
the same ones that robbed my store, when Crooks and
I were in partnership! They mean trouble.”</p>

<p>But the children of the plains realized that the
whites were in force, and, fearing that they might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
attempt to punish them for their former actions,
peacefully accepted several presents which were offered
them. Again the trappers forced their way up
the swift waters, but again they were surprised by
a group of red men, who rode up the bank, and, in
a lordly and insolent manner, demanded presents similar
to those which had recently been given to their
brethren. This angered the trappers, for they appreciated
the fact that the redskins wished to frighten
them.</p>

<p>“You shall not get a single thing from us,” shouted
Hunt,&mdash;a man of great firmness. “Furthermore, if
you make any more insolent demands, I will treat you
all as enemies and turn our cannon against you.”</p>

<p>This did not please the savages, as can be well
imagined. Vowing vengeance, and shaking their fists
at the trappers, they rode off across the prairie, while
the whites were now divided into two forces; one
going up one bank, and the other taking the opposite
side. Thus they proceeded for several days, until they
came to a spot where the stream was very narrow and
was filled with sand bars. A vast number of redskins
were camped upon the western bank, and Hunt
was fearful that they would soon attack. He and
McLellan were in one of the boats.</p>

<p>“I know that they are peaceful,” said the former,
“for their faces are painted. Row to the shore!”</p>

<p>As they approached, the savages dropped their bows
and arrows, came to meet them joyfully, and proved
to be a band of Arickaras who were at war with the
Sioux, and were thus anxious to have the white trappers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
assist in fighting their battles for them. “How!
How!” said they. “We glad to see our white brothers.
How! How! We wish to have sticks which
speak with the voice of thunder.”</p>

<p>The adventurers looked forward to rich trade with
the red men but were much surprised and angered by
receiving word that the boat of Lisa&mdash;the Spaniard&mdash;was
rapidly approaching.</p>

<p>“That rascally fellow will ruin our work!” cried
McLellan, with considerable heat. “We must let him
know, now, that we will stand no trickery from him.
If he tampers with these redskins and sets them
against me, I will let my rifle do the work of vengeance.”</p>

<p>The Indians, meanwhile, showed no disposition to
trade, knowing that the presence of a rival trader
would ensure them better bargains. Lisa soon arrived
and was not long in discovering that he was an unwelcome
guest. McLellan had difficulty in restraining
himself from wreaking a just vengeance upon this
artful “Greaser,” but fearing that he might involve
Hunt and his other friends in a quarrel, kept his own
counsel. It was, however, not for long.</p>

<p>Lisa agreed that he and Hunt would go to the
Indian village and would trade there, but that no
advantage should be taken of one another in the
transactions with the wild riders of the plains. After
a short delay they proceeded together up the river.
But the crafty Spaniard was soon up to his old tricks
and attempted to induce a certain French Canadian,
in Hunt’s employ, to leave his master.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>“I will give you better wages and treatment,” said
he. “Come&mdash;boy&mdash;be one of my followers.”</p>

<p>This was overheard by McLellan and infuriated
him. Seizing a gun, he gave the Spaniard to understand
that he had old scores to settle with him, and
that he had better get his own pistol and defend himself,
for he was soon to be shot down like a dog.
“You thieving, sneaking Greaser!” he shouted.
“Now you will go to Kingdom Come in a hurry.
You should have been beneath the sod long
ago.”</p>

<p>Fire flashed from the Spaniard’s eyes and he
reached for his pistol, but, before he could draw, the
angered McLellan was seized by both Hunt and
Crooks, who took his weapon away from him and
pinned him to the ground, until he promised that he
would not touch the Spaniard. Lisa himself was careful
not to again rouse the ire of the pioneer, and, as
a result, did not attempt to underbid the trade offers
to the Arickaras. Successful bartering was soon accomplished,
and Hunt’s party set about the difficult
undertaking of crossing through the Rocky Mountains
and traversing the dry table-land to the Pacific
coast.</p>

<p>You can well realize that this was a hazardous
undertaking, for, not only did the trappers have a
hazy and undefined conception of the route to follow,
but there was little water in certain parts of this
country, and a great scarcity of game in others.
There were sixty-two in the adventurous band, with
eighty-two pack-horses to carry luggage, guns, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
camp equipment. All were well armed and were full
of determination to succeed.</p>

<p>As the adventurous little body of trappers filed
silently towards the West&mdash;a few days later&mdash;the
Indians collected in order to bid them good-by.
Many an old chief was seen to shake his head, as they
wended their way towards the beetling mountains,
and the treacherous, though adventurous, Lisa was
heard to exclaim: “These men are fools! They are
all dead! All dead! None will ever return!” But
these pessimistic remarks did not seem to worry the
followers of Hunt and McLellan. With cheerful
looks and smiling faces they kept onward towards
their goal.</p>

<p>Soon they were in the glorious Big Horn range
and were in the vicinity of the tepees of many Indians,
who were not slow in discovering their approach.
Contrary to every expectation, the red men
greeted them most hospitably, gave them dried buffalo
meat, and told them how to find a way through
the rugged hills before them. These were the Cheyennes&mdash;a
war-like tribe&mdash;which had its name from
the Cheyenne River. They were soon to be driven
from their hunting-grounds by the steady, westward
emigration of the whites, but were now rich in both
ponies and buffalo robes, and were much feared by
the neighboring denizens of the plains: the Crows and
Ogalala Sioux.</p>

<p>The pioneers kept on, traded with the redskins
whom they met, and found increased dangers and
difficulties in their path. It was summer, and thousands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
of gnats and mosquitoes attacked both men and
horses, rendering life miserable and making it most
disagreeable to proceed. I, myself, travelled through
this country in the summer of 1899, and have never
seen so many pests as here. Swarms of green-headed
horse-flies attacked our pack animals, so that they
would sometimes be bloody from their bites. Often
the horses would roll upon the ground in order to get
rid of the flies, and thus would dislodge the packs,
which had taken some time to adjust. Their sting
was most poisonous. Mosquitoes were here by the
millions, and we had great difficulty&mdash;even then&mdash;of
getting through the fallen timber, which sometimes
extended for many miles. These pioneers
picked their way through the forests, forded the
rushing streams, ascended and descended the deep
canyons, and finally reached the headwaters of the
Mad River, or Snake River, as it is called below its
junction with Henry’s Fork.</p>

<p>An adventurous trader named Henry had here established
a trading-post, the year before, but becoming
disgusted with the Indians, who refused to barter
with him, had abandoned it. Hunt, McLellan, and
their little party, reached this spot on the eighth day
of October, where they stopped to recruit their
strength. Then they engaged Indians to look out for
their horses, which they concluded to leave behind
them, and built a number of canoes with which to
commit themselves to the current of the river. They
embarked, and, for a hundred miles found their progress
easy, but all at once they saw to their dismay that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
below them were dangerous falls and treacherous
rapids. Their journey was blocked.</p>

<p>It was impossible to return to Henry’s Fork, where
were their horses, and to go on meant the destruction
of all their supplies. What was there to do? To the
North was the Columbia River, but an unbroken wilderness
lay between. They must cross it, trust to luck
that game would come their way, and that their rifles
would not miss it when found. There were but a few
days’ provisions left, so it was decided to divide the
party into four sections: the first, under Crooks, was
to make its way up the river to Fort Henry; the
second, under McLellan, was to continue down the
Snake; while the third, under McKenzie, was to
traverse the wilderness towards the Columbia. The
fourth section was to remain for a time where it was.
And it was further understood that any party which
should come across assistance or supplies should return
to the main body under Hunt, which would hold
the present camp until their leader became convinced
that all had failed in their efforts to reach their destination.
Let us see how they fared.</p>

<p>McLellan continued his way down the rushing
Snake with three companions, but, finding that it was
almost impossible to make further progress, he deflected
his line of march so as to follow the detachment
under McKenzie. Their course was over a bare
and arid country where there was no game and little
water. Occasionally a jack-rabbit scampered between
the clumps of sage brush, but no one seemed to have
sufficient ability with the rifle in order to bring one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
down. A lean coyote would now and again be seen,
and often the weird wailing of one of these creatures
would make night hideous. The jerked buffalo meat
which they carried was soon exhausted and the adventurers
began to suffer from the gnawing pains of
hunger, but on they walked with grim and steadfast
determination. Weary, footsore, and nearly exhausted,
they finally came upon McKenzie and his five
companions. These fortunately had food, which they
gave to the gaunt trappers, who rested for a full day
before they could go on.</p>

<p>McLellan was undaunted. Trained in a hundred
combats with the savages of the West, and hardened
by years of exposure, he saw no cause for despondency.
Some of the trappers, however, gave way to
despair. They were among the barren drifts and extinct
craters of gigantic volcanoes, while, through the
winding fissures of its canyoned walls, the furious torrent
of the Snake River dashed, foamed, and roared
beneath them. Like a snow-white ribbon it plunged
onward upon its wild career, and, in the sobbing roar
of its cataracts, some of the more weak-hearted fancied
that they heard the voices of those departed, who
called to them to follow where they had gone.</p>

<p>It grew cold. A fierce snow-storm came upon them.
As the food supply was gone, a dozen beaver skins
were cut into strips and roasted, but this provender
only sustained life for a few days. At length the trappers
became exhausted, and, crouching under the protecting
ledge of a wall of rock, shivered before their
fire, and gloomily looked forth upon the blinding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
snow. All was sadness and despondency. Some contemplated
death, which they thought to be inevitable,
and even the lion-hearted McLellan lost that undaunted
courage which had never before deserted
him. Could it be that they were to die before they
saw the roaring waters of the Columbia? Could it be
that they were to perish before they reached the
trader’s post upon the green-gray stretch of the Pacific
Ocean?</p>

<p>Peering into the gloom from his rocky shelter, the
keen eyes of McLellan suddenly perceived a buffalo,
which, driven to the rocky wall by the desire to get
away from the blinding snow, was crouching under
the lee of a high bluff. What could be more fortunate?
Taking note of the direction of the wind, the
trapper left his hiding-place and crawled against it,
until he came within thirty yards of the beast. Carefully
he wormed his way behind a jutting ledge of
rock and sand, then&mdash;taking a good sight&mdash;touched
the trigger of his rifle, and the great lumbering brute
fell dead. With a wild and hilarious cheer the old
scout dashed to where he lay and cut joyful capers
around him in the snow. “Hurray! Hurray!” he
cried. “Now we will have enough food to last us
for many days. Hurray! Hurray!”</p>

<p>Seizing upon the carcass of the beast, the old scout
rolled him down the hill towards the cavern in which
his own companions were shivering. With a wild yell
he announced his triumph and this was answered by
a hoarse cry from the half-famished trappers, who
rushed upon the beast, and, but for the warning of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
the old frontiersman, would have gorged themselves
upon the raw flesh, so great was their hunger.</p>

<p>“Hold back, my friends,” cried he. “Wait but a
moment and I will give you some cooked food. Restrain
yourselves, for a few seconds, and I will see that
you get enough to save your lives. Eat the raw flesh
and you will all perish.”</p>

<p>It was difficult to hold back the starving trappers,
but soon a fire was lighted, the choicest parts of the
buffalo were broiled upon a ramrod, and the gaunt
spectres were allowed a feast. This saved their lives.
With renewed strength they again made their way
towards the Columbia, and, meeting with an occasional
buffalo which they had the good fortune to kill,
at length reached the swirling river, where a band of
roving red men supplied them with a number of
canoes. They also secured sufficient jerked meat to
last them until they should reach the coast, where the
trading-post of Astoria had already been established.
To that lucky shot of McLellan’s they owed their
lives.</p>

<p>Hunt, meanwhile, had decided that the three parties
had successfully made their way to the coast, so he
had started for the Columbia. Crooks had reached
Fort Henry, where he spent his time in trapping and
in trading with the redskins. As for the trappers who
had left for Astoria by sea, they had met with an adverse
fate, for the savages had induced them to enter
the mouth of a small river, when they reached the
neighborhood of the trading-post, and here had surrounded
and massacred all of the voyageurs, after the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
vessel had been run aground. It took Hunt over a
month to arrive at the coast. Crooks eventually followed.
He met the other trappers after a separation
of five months’ duration.</p>

<p>After frightful privations and suffering the four
parties were now safe at Astoria; a trading-post which
was to create a fortune for its founder, John Jacob
Astor, a shrewd merchant of New York, who was a
dealer in furs and peltries of wild animals. But there
was still travelling to be done, for Hunt determined
soon after his arrival to send a party overland, in
order to notify Astor of the loss of the detachment
which had come by sea.</p>

<p>Strange to relate, the lion-hearted McLellan announced
that he intended to go back with this party
to St. Louis. “For,” said he, “I have not been given
a sufficient share of the profits of this company. I
am entitled to more.” His friends begged him to remain
and not again to plunge into the wilderness,
where were dangers just as great as those from which
he had escaped. But he was obstinate in his purpose.
“To St. Louis I shall go,” said he, “and not all the
redskins on the earth will stop me. I have been
treated most unfairly.” Thus, on the twenty-second
day of March, 1812, he turned his back upon Astoria,
and set out upon the hazardous trip towards the East.
The detachment was under the command of John
Reed, clerk of the Fur Company, a man of undoubted
courage and experience in frontier warfare.</p>

<p>There were seventeen in this particular expedition,
all men of well tried courage and resource in wilderness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
adventure. Ascending the Columbia in canoes,
they reached the falls and were preparing to make the
portage when a band of redskins surrounded them and
began to shoot arrows at their ranks. The trappers
crouched behind the protection of trees and boulders,
and made a stand, sending many a humming bullet
into the ranks of the savages, who suddenly ceased
hostilities, and, holding up their hands in sign of peace,
came towards the white men. Mingling with the
travellers, the Indians offered to carry their luggage
around the rapids.</p>

<p>“The redskins only want to steal all that we’ve
got,” whispered McLellan to his men. “But we can
let them carry the canoes around the falls. Then we
can get the baggage over during the night, and, when
morning dawns, we’ll be off before the varmints know
what we’re up to.”</p>

<p>The redskins seemed to be well satisfied. They
carried the canoes upon their broad shoulders, and, as
night fell, retired to their village across the river,
leaving a few upon the same side as the whites. McLellan
waited until the moon rose; then waking the
others, he told them to get their baggage around the
falls as soon as they could. The trappers worked industriously,
and just as day was breaking, they deposited
the last sack of provisions at the head of the
rapids. This had been done without waking the redskins,
who were upon their side of the river.</p>

<p>But now was an uproar, for the savages across the
stream learned what was going on, and, in a few
moments, came swarming to the attack. A hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
of them rushed upon the nervy band of trappers, crying
out, “You no go on. You stay here. You no
go away.”</p>

<p>Brandishing aloft an immense club, a red warrior
rushed upon Reed and felled him to the ground. Another
ran towards McLellan, who, with rifle in hand,
stood watching the affray. As he approached, the
trapper was ready, and, although the redskin attempted
to throw a buffalo robe over his head in
order to blind his vision as he made a thrust at him
with his knife, the old scout was too wary a bird to
be caught napping. Stepping quickly aside, he shot
the savage dead. As the redskin rolled over, a noise
sounded from behind, and, wheeling around, he was
just in time to hit another Indian who was about to
shoot him with a rifle. The trappers now rallied to
the defense of their leader. The savage who had attacked
Reed was dispatched just as he was about to
brain the trapper with his tomahawk. The rifles of
the men from Astoria spoke in unison, and terrified
by the desperate courage of the rangers, the savages
dropped back. McLellan urged his followers to the
charge, and, with a wild yell, they rushed upon the
redskins, who took to their heels, leaving many of
their number prostrate upon the ground.</p>

<p>The unfortunate Reed had lost his dispatches to
Astor, for he carried them in a bright, new, tin box
which immediately attracted the attention of the Indians.
They fancied that it must be of great value,
because of the care which the leader took of it. But
this put an end to the expedition. Reluctantly and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
sadly the trappers returned to the trading-post, where
the wounded recovered from their injuries received
in the little skirmish with the red men.</p>

<p>Hunt was greatly disappointed. “Boys!” said he,
“I must absolutely get my dispatches through to
Saint Louis,&mdash;Indians or no Indians. Astor must
know of the fate of his other division. I will start
a second expedition in June and Robert Stuart will
be its commander. He will take only four good men
with him.”</p>

<p>McLellan announced that he would be a member of
the party, and Crooks also declared that he would leave
Astoria, because he had become dissatisfied with the
method in which Hunt had treated him. They soon
launched their canoes in the Columbia; began to paddle
up the stream, and, before long, reached the mouth
of the Walla-Walla, where they hid their frail craft,
and started across country to the Snake River.
Horses had been purchased from the red men, and
with these they made good time, although again their
food supply became exhausted so that they were forced
to scrape the fur from beaver and buffalo skins and
eat the hide in order to keep from starving. Fortunately
game was now met with and this provender
saved their lives.</p>

<p>At the place where they had last camped on Snake
River they had buried a quantity of dried meat and
other food, but when they arrived there they discovered
that the redskins had found out its whereabouts,
had dug it up, and had carried it away. It
was growing cold, but they pressed forward with renewed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
courage, and entered a country which was free
from game, so that again they were threatened with
the dangers of starvation. Besides this, it was the
land of the Crow Indians, who were terrific thieves
and who soon discovered the presence of the little
band of trappers. The sharp eyes of McLellan&mdash;well
used to watching game&mdash;were not long in discovering
the presence of the Indians.</p>

<p>“Look out boys,” said he. “I notice some of the
red varmints hovering near by and suspect that we
will be attacked before long. Look to the priming of
your rifles and have plenty of ammunition handy. Be
on your guard!”</p>

<p>The trappers gave good heed to this warning and
redoubled their guards around the camp at nightfall.
It was well that they did so, for, on the very next day,
a large band of red men rode up to their halting-place,
all fully armed with spears and arrows.</p>

<p>“Ugh! Ugh!” said the spokesman. “Where are
my white brothers going?”</p>

<p>McLellan answered for the trappers that they were
upon a peaceful errand and would not molest the red
men, if they in turn would do them no harm. As he
spoke, the redskins looked carefully at the men of the
frontier, and, seeing them well armed and ready for
business, decided not to attack. But they travelled
with them for six whole days, quietly stealing any
little articles that they could find, and, on the evening
of the sixth day, ran off all the horses of the trappers
in a mad stampede. The white adventurers were in
a desperate situation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>Stuart, the commander, now spoke vigorous words.</p>

<p>“We must cache everything which we cannot carry,
and push on,” said he. “Let winter overtake us in
this God-forsaken country and all is lost. On! On!”</p>

<p>As the men were busily engaged in digging a hole
in which to bury the supplies, one of the trappers interrupted
them.</p>

<p>“Two of those thieving Crows are watching us,”
said he, “and they will dig everything up just as soon
as we disappear.”</p>

<p>McLellan grew furious at this information.</p>

<p>“No thieving Crow will ever get anything of mine,”
said he, “unless they get my scalp first. I’ll burn
everything which we leave behind, and then let Mr.
Redskin hustle for the white man’s food.”</p>

<p>“You’re right!” answered all. “Burn it we will!”
Their stores were soon piled up into a heap and
were consumed by the flames.</p>

<p>They now headed for the Mad River, where they
built rafts, and floated them down these turbid waters,
for several days. Then they again struck off across
country towards the East, crossing a wide plateau to
the base of the Rocky Mountains. They were in the
land of the Blackfeet Indians, who were as hostile
towards the whites as were the Crows, and who were
as arrant thieves; but they kept on towards the high
land, hoping thus to elude the red men. As they proceeded
into the mountains, McLellan bitterly complained
against their course and begged them to remain
upon the plateau. “For,” said he, “I’ve already
had enough mountain climbing to last me a lifetime,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
and I’d rather be comfortably killed by the Indians
than break my neck falling down a canyon. You boys
would rather climb mountains than fight the redskins.”</p>

<p>To these remarks Stuart and his companions paid
no attention, but kept on their way. McLellan was
liked by all, and one trapper offered to give him a load
of jerked meat to carry, instead of the traps.</p>

<p>“A hunter should be able to kill his own meat
without carrying any,” said the old pioneer, who was
now thoroughly angry. “Who wants to carry a
whole horse-load of dried beef on his back? As for
me, I’ll go no further with you. Fools! Good-by!”
This burst of temper seemed to relieve his mind,
and, starting down the mountain, he set out alone
without once looking behind him. His companions
kept on, and as they reached the top of the eminence,
gazed over the plain, where a dark spot marked the
form of the angered man of the frontier.</p>

<p>“Boys,” said Stuart. “There goes the last of the
old pioneers of the Kentucky border. You will never
see him or his like again.”</p>

<p>As he said this, the eyes of many of his companions
filled with tears.</p>

<p>Events were not to go smoothly with either McLellan
or Stuart, for the former lost his way; became
so weak from lack of food that he was unable to go
further; and wandered aimlessly about. The latter
also suffered terribly from hunger, but kept on, hoping
to meet with game at every mile. His men were
footsore and dejected, for they entered upon a barren<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
region where there was no game, and where even the
coyotes seemed to have disappeared. They became
desperate, and determined to throw themselves upon
the mercy of the malicious Blackfeet, should they
come across them.</p>

<p>With this end in view, the voyageurs kept a sharp
lookout for Indian fires, hoping to gain food and assistance
from the red men. Suddenly, in the far distance,
they saw the twinkle of a little light and knew
that some living being was near them. But it was
late in the day. So they dispatched one of their number
to see who it was, while the rest went into camp
for the night. The messenger did not return.</p>

<p>Upon the day following, the exhausted plainsmen
hastened in the direction of the fire which they had
seen the evening before, and met their companion running
towards them.</p>

<p>“Boys,” said he, “’Old Bob’ McLellan is lying
by that fire in an absolutely exhausted condition. He
is so weak that unless some stimulant is given him he
will expire. Hurry and give him food from our
meagre supply!”</p>

<p>This hastened the feet of the trappers, and reaching
the place where the stubborn-minded old pioneer was
lying, they discovered that he was in a desperate
plight. A cup of hot coffee, however, soon revived
him, so that he was able to struggle to his feet and
join in their weary march. His rifle was carried by
one of his companions.</p>

<p>The little party pressed on, luckily came across a
“solitary,” or bull buffalo, which had been driven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
from the herd because of old age and infirmity, and
had the good fortune to kill it. Strengthened by this
repast, they stumbled forward, and, by great good
chance, came upon a band of Snake Indians, who fed
them, gave them buckskin for moccasins, and, at their
departure, not only presented them with a goodly
quantity of jerked meat, but also with an old horse
to carry it. Winter was coming on. Small flurries
of snow announced the advent of the season, but they
were now nearing the river Platte, where was an
abundance of game. The old scout had recovered
from his exhaustion and was once more the leader of
these heroic plainsmen, who had twice been upon the
verge of starvation. Their emaciated forms had
filled out; their faces were sunburned and glowed
with health; while their spirits and their strength was
as of yore.</p>

<p>It was well into November when the party reached
the river Platte, where were quantities of antelope
and buffalo upon the grassy plains which rolled from
either bank. They had a big hunt and collected sufficient
buffalo meat to last through the winter. Then
they built a hut of logs and plastered it with mud,
determined to remain here until the warmth of spring
made it possible for them to move further upon their
long journey to the settlements. The days passed
pleasantly, but one morning they were awakened by
the wild screeching of a band of savages, and rushing
to the doorway of their cabin, found that they were
surrounded by fully a hundred painted braves.</p>

<p>“Well,” said McLellan, “I&mdash;for one&mdash;am all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
ready for a brush with the redskins, whom I hate as
much as I do old Lisa: the dastardly Spanish trickster.
So, my fine fellows, look to your rifles and we’ll
have a little picnic.”</p>

<p>“Not so fast,” Stuart interrupted. “I believe that
these fellows are peaceably disposed towards us.”
And&mdash;so saying&mdash;he stepped forth from the door,
rifle in one hand, the other extended towards the Indians.
Several of them came forward, shook his hand
with heartiness, and intimated that they wished to
have peace and not warfare. One of the chiefs could
speak good English.</p>

<p>“We are on the war-path,” said he. “We are
Cheyennes and our enemies are the Crows, who have
raided one of our villages, have stolen many ponies
and much dried meat. They shall be punished.”</p>

<p>This was cheerful news.</p>

<p>“Well,” murmured Stuart, “here we are between
two fires. On one side are the Cheyennes, on the
other are the Crows. As they are both upon the war-path,
we are in continual danger from each of them.
If a war party is defeated, it will doubtless wreak
vengeance upon us when returning from the fray.
The only thing for us to do is to take our chances and
move towards the East.”</p>

<p>The situation was presented to the rest of the trappers,
all of whom were of the opinion that they should
decamp. Winter was upon them and snow was deep
upon the ground, but, if they would save their lives,
they must leave at once. The raw-boned old horse
was loaded up, their packs were slung on their own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
shoulders, and, upon the thirteenth day of December,
the band of adventurers set off down the Platte.
Snow-storms and bitter winds assailed them, but on
they struggled until well beyond the range of the war-like
savages. Here they built another hut, passed the
winter in peace, and in March, 1813, started down the
river in canoes which they had made from hollowed
stumps of trees. After an uneventful trip, they finally
reached the Missouri and were soon on their way to
the frontier trading-post of St. Louis. Astor then
learned what had happened to the adventurous souls
who had attempted to reach his trading-post by sea.</p>

<p>The hazardous trip was over at last. “Old Bob”
McLellan and his companions had crossed the wildest
portion of an unexplored continent; had endured
terrific hardship and exposure; but had brought home
an accurate description of the virgin West to the
hearing of many adventurous souls, who&mdash;thronging
upon the border&mdash;were anxious and eager to press
into the unknown prairie and mountain land. Two or
three times the trappers had just escaped death by
starvation. Twice they had barely missed a massacre
by the redskins. Yet their courage and fortitude had
carried them through every peril, and at last they
were among their own kind, where appreciation of
their nerve and valor was freely shown.</p>

<p>What of “Old Bob” McLellan, as he was affectionately
called? Alas! The sinewy plainsman had
been much broken by the hardships of this arduous
journey to Astoria. Exposure and starvation had
done its work upon the frame of the hardy man of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
the frontier, and now he was unable to again venture
into the unknown. Purchasing a stock of goods suitable
for a trader, he opened a country store at Cape
Girardeau, near St. Louis, but the angel of death even
then hovered over the soul of the stalwart man of the
plains. In a few months he quietly passed into the
great beyond.</p>

<p>Thus peacefully ended the career of one of the last
of the valorous scouts and pioneers who had forced
back the savage hordes from the Alleghanies to the
Mississippi, and who, even as old age advanced, had
plunged into an unexplored and unpeopled country,
to risk both life and limb among savage men and
beasts. Red ran the blood in the veins of this vigorous
Kentuckian, and he is to be remembered as a
good type of the venturesome pioneers who explored
and opened to white civilization the vast and unknown
regions of western America. The hazardous journey
to Astoria quite equalled in danger that eventful pilgrimage
of Lewis and Clark, the first white adventurers
to cross the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific.
Hats off to “Old Bob” McLellan.</p>

<div class="break">

<h2 class="p4">COLONEL BENJAMIN LOGAN:</h2>

<p class="pch">THE INTREPID FIGHTER OF THE
KENTUCKY FRONTIER</p>


<p class="drop-cap01">“MOTHER, I know that the law allows me to
have all of the property which my father
left, but I do not want it. You can have
your share, and to my brothers and sisters I give the
remainder. I, myself, will move further West, into
the wilderness.”</p>

<p>The youth who spoke was about twenty-one years
of age; tall, slender, and graceful. His face was
open, frank, and expressive. As he ceased, he waved
his hand towards the West and left the room in
which his parent was sitting upon an old-fashioned
horse-hair sofa. His name was Benjamin Logan.</p>

<p>Although the old English law of primogeniture prevailed
in Virginia at this time, which gave the farm,
horses, and farming utensils to young Logan (upon
the death of his father) he refused to accept them.
Instead of this, he nobly partitioned the estate between
his mother, his three brothers, and two sisters,
and removed to the Holston River. Then he began
to farm a rough piece of ground, only part of which
had been cleared of timber.</p>

<p>About this time the Indians upon the Ohio frontier
became very troublesome, and Logan enlisted as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
private in the army of Lord Dunmore, Governor of
Virginia. Marching into the Indian country was a
rough experience, but the youth enjoyed it, and when
the red men signed articles of peace at Chillicothe,
Ohio, the stout Virginian was among those who stood
near the chiefs and saw them put their names to the
agreement. Kentucky was now fairly peaceable. So
the energetic young man moved his family to Harrodsburg,
where a stockade had been erected called
Logan’s Fort.</p>

<p>“You must look out for the redskins,” said a comrade
to him. “Although they have signed an agreement
to let us alone, my friends report that there are
many of them in the vicinity, and they are all daubed
up with paint, because they are upon the war-path.”</p>

<p>“I will be on my guard,” replied the young pioneer.
“We must all run to the fort if there is danger
of attack.” The test was to come sooner than he expected.</p>

<p>Upon a balmy day in May, when the women were
milking their cows near the gate of Fort Logan, and
a few men were standing by, in order to assist them,
a small band of redskins appeared at the edge of a
thicket. <i>Crash</i>, a volley woke the stillness, and one of
the frontiersmen fell dead while two staggered behind
the log breastwork, with mortal wounds. A third&mdash;a
stout fellow called Harrison&mdash;was unable to reach
the gate, and dragged himself along to the shelter of
some bushes.</p>

<p>Within the fort, all gazed with sorrow at the
wounded pioneer, who, although in range of the Indian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
rifles, was so protected that the balls could not
quite reach him. Those in the fort kept up a fusillade
in the direction of the red men, making them get
below cover, and thus the battle continued; the leaden
balls zipping and whizzing across the place, where
Harrison lay partially concealed. The man’s family,
in the fort, seemed to be in an agony of distress at his
terrible condition. To save him would require great
nerve and heroism. There were but fifteen men in
the stockade; two were badly wounded. Should they
sacrifice any of this small number in the endeavor to
rescue a man, who, even should he be retaken, would
be unable to fight in defense of the fortification? This
question confronted the beleaguered pioneers, and it
was a serious one.</p>

<p>At this moment young Logan stepped forward and
said:</p>

<p>“Who will go with me to the rescue of this poor
fellow?”</p>

<p>It was strange to see the effect of these words upon
the besieged frontiersmen. At first every one refused.</p>

<p>“I’m not a fast runner,” said one, “and know that
they will easily catch me on the return trip, even if I
am not shot before I reach the wounded man.”</p>

<p>A second&mdash;a fellow of giant build&mdash;quavered:
“I am a weakly chap. I never was no good, nohow,
on liftin’. Perhaps you’d better git ernother stouter
feller than I be.”</p>

<p>Still a third remarked that, “he wuz plum onlucky
with Injin bullets, an’ never wuz known tew git<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
amongst ’em in the open without havin’ one uv ’em
nick him.”</p>

<p>Ben Logan could not help smiling at this.</p>

<p>“What, are you all afraid to follow me?” said
he.</p>

<p>At this, a trapper called John Martin stepped towards
him, and said:</p>

<p>“I will go with you, for I can only die once and
I am as ready now to go to my Maker, as I ever will
be. Come on! To the rescue!”</p>

<p>“You are a man after my own heart,” answered
the bold pioneer, grasping him warmly by the hand.
“We will start at once.”</p>

<p>Throwing open the gates to the stockade, both
dashed towards the prostrate frontiersman. They
had proceeded about five yards from the fort when
Harrison made an effort to rise. As he got to his
hands and knees, Martin turned and fled to the stockade.</p>

<p>“This is fine treatment,” mused Logan, but he
kept on under a veritable shower of bullets from the
redskins. Fortune favored him; he was not hit, and
reaching the wounded frontiersman in safety, clasped
him in his arms, and began to lug him back to the
fort. The deed was a noble one.</p>

<p>Bullets from the red men fairly poured around the
struggling backwoodsman, as he staggered towards
the stockade of logs. His hat was pierced by a ball;
one even penetrated his hunting-shirt, but, in spite of
this, he finally reached the doorway. Hurrah! As
he deposited the body of the wounded man safely upon
the ground a mighty cheer welled from the throats of
all. Hurrah! Hurrah, for Benjamin Logan!</p>

<p class="vh"><a name="i075" id="i075">i075</a></p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>Even the Hercules who had complained of being
“a weakly fellow” threw up his hat in the air.</p>

<p>“Well, by Gum! Logan,” said he, “if yew ain’t
th’ plum luckiest feller I ever knowed. I believe that
yew be charmed, so ez an Injun bullet can’t hit yew.
Ez fer me? Why, I would hev been struck er dozen
times in thet hazardous journey. Huzzah! says I.
Here’s tew yer!”</p>

<p>But all danger was not yet over by any means. The
red men were in numbers, and besieged the fort with
a tenacity that made matters take a decidedly ugly
look, for the few men of the garrison were not able
to put up a very stiff fire against the increasing bands
of Indians. Another danger also threatened, for the
supply of ammunition became exhausted. How was
more to be obtained?</p>

<p>Distant, about a hundred miles, was the frontier
settlement on the Holston River, to which Logan had
first moved when he left his farm in Virginia. Here
was ammunition in abundance, and also supplies of
food and clothing. Would any one have nerve enough
to creep through and relieve the beleaguered garrison?
This required the greatest judgment and unbounded
courage, for the intervening country was swarming
with savages, all upon the war-path. It was a region
full of deep ravines, tangled thickets, and treacherous
swampland.</p>

<p>Again all were asked to undertake the journey, but
there were as many excuses as before. Again Benjamin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
Logan stepped into the breach and offered to
bring relief. That night he clambered to the top of
the stockade, dropped softly to the ground outside,
and soon his form was lost in the shadows of the
encircling forest. He passed through the Indian lines
in safety, and, by daybreak, was headed for the post
at Holston. His last words to the garrison were:
“Hold fast! Hold on! I will be sure to return within
a fortnight and you will all be saved!”</p>

<p>For several days the garrison returned the fire of
the Indians with spirit, but, as the hours fled by, a
terrible feeling of despair came over them. Their
water began to give out; their ammunition was so
low that they had to use it sparingly, and the food
supply was in such a condition that there was danger
of starvation if help did not soon arrive. Logan,
meanwhile, was toiling upon his way through by-paths,
swamps and cane brakes, having deserted the
beaten trail through Cumberland Gap. Fortune favored
him. He met with no prowling red men, and,
within six days, had covered the distance to the
frontier post.</p>

<p>The intrepid pioneer now procured ammunition,
food, and a company of backwoodsmen. With these,
he hastened onwards towards his beleaguered companions,
and, upon the tenth day after his departure,
suddenly appeared before the stockade. There were
not twenty rounds of ammunition left in the fortress.
Gaunt and hollow cheeks were here. Noble women
upheld the fainting spirits of the men, but now, with
little hope of succor, it was with difficulty that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
kept up their fire upon the redskins, and put out the
flaming brands which they kept throwing into the
stockade. A wild and exultant cheer greeted their
leader as he ran across the clearing to the door of the
side wall. “At last you have come!” they shouted.
“We had given you up for dead!”</p>

<p>A few days later Colonel Bowman arrived, with a
large body of men, at which the Indians raised the
siege and fled. But they had not gone for good. On
the contrary, they fairly swarmed over the borders
of Kentucky and their marauding parties committed
some frightful outrages. There was nothing now to
be done but to defeat them in a battle and burn
their villages, if the white settlers were to have
peace.</p>

<p>It was the year 1779. The Revolution was over.
England had lost her colonies to her own sons. Now
the Colonists were beginning the great struggle to
free themselves from the curse of Indian invasion.
An expedition was therefore organized to invade the
Shawnee territory and to raze to the ground the famous
town of Chillicothe. Benjamin Logan&mdash;now
Colonel Logan&mdash;was second in command. Bowman,
who had come to the rescue at Logan’s Fort, was to
lead the expedition; which was to consist of one hundred
and sixty men. They advanced in the heat of
July, and marched with such precaution that they
reached the neighborhood of the Indian town without
having been discovered by the enemy.</p>

<p>A plan for assaulting the village was now decided
upon. It was very simple, for the force was to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
divided into two parts; one, under Logan, was to
march to the left: the other, under Bowman, was to
march to the right. The men were to spread out in
single rank, and when the leading files of the two
columns had met, then, they were to attack. It was
dark when the backwoods soldiers began the advance.
Logan’s men quite encircled the town, but where was
Bowman? All through the night the leader of the
left flank waited for the coming of the other column,
but not a man in buckskin appeared. Hour after hour
passed away and the darkness gave way to dawn. Still
Bowman was strangely missing.</p>

<p>“Had you not better attack?” whispered one of his
men. “The Shawnees will soon be awake and will
discover our whereabouts.”</p>

<p>“Let us wait another hour or two,” answered the
courageous leader. “I believe that the advance of
Bowman’s column will soon be here.”</p>

<p>Logan’s men were secreted in ambush. Here they
remained until an Indian dog began to bark, arousing
his master, who came out of his tepee in order to see
what was the matter. An imprudent trapper had exposed
his head above the underbrush, and the keen
eyes of the redskin quickly discerned an enemy. He
raised a loud war-whoop.</p>

<p>As he did this, a gun went off on Bowman’s side of
the village, and, seeing that further concealment was
useless, Colonel Logan cried out to his men:</p>

<p>“Charge into the village, my boys. You must
drive the redskins through the town, for Colonel Bowman
will surely support you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>His buckskin-clad rangers defiled quickly into the
village, and, advancing from cabin to cabin, soon had
reached a large building in the centre. The Indians
fled swiftly before them, but later, recovering from
their surprise, endeavored to turn the right flank of
the Kentuckians, whom they perceived to be in small
numbers. Where was Colonel Bowman?</p>

<p>The Shawnees had now seized their own rifles and
were pouring in a hot fire upon the advancing frontiersmen,
who tore the heavy doors from the Indian
cabins, formed a breastwork, and protected themselves
from the whizzing balls. They were holding their
own and were making progress towards the Indian
citadel, where most of the braves had collected, when
an order came from Colonel Bowman to retreat. His
ranking officer had spoken, so there was nothing for
Logan to do but to obey.</p>

<p>As soon as the men were told that they must go to
the rear, a tumultuous scene commenced. Dispirited
and disheartened by the order to turn their backs upon
the enemy, they rushed away from the tomahawks and
balls of the savages, as best they were able. The Indians
were astonished and jubilant over the turn which
matters had taken and pursued the rangers with wild
and exultant yelping. The frontiersmen scattered in
every direction, dodging and twisting in order to
avoid the balls which whistled around them, and ran
from cabin to cabin, in confusion. Suddenly they
collided with Bowman’s soldiers, who, because of
some panic of their commander, had stood stock still
near the spot where Logan had left them the night<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
before. The redskins soon surrounded them on all
sides, and kept up a hot fire.</p>

<p>What was the matter with Bowman? He sat upon
his horse like a pillar of stone; gave no orders; and
was in an apparently helpless mental condition. His
men paid no attention to him, but swarmed to the
protection of trees and stumps, took aim at the yelping
red men, and soon held them at a safe distance.
When they seemed to be quieted, the frontiersmen resumed
their march. The Indians, however, came
back to the attack, but were beaten off. They followed,
and made an assault every half mile, or so.
Their tenacity was due to the fact that they expected
reinforcements and hoped to annihilate the whites.</p>

<p>“Keep together, my brave men,” shouted Colonel
Logan, at this juncture. “Do not let these redskins
stampede you, for then you will all be massacred.”</p>

<p>The crisis was a terrible one. The retreat would
become a rout, unless the soldiers were kept together.</p>

<p>At this juncture Colonel Logan and a few of the
boldest souls, dashed into the brush, on horseback, and
cut down some of the nearest red men. As they performed
this bold feat, the savages held back, and thus
allowed the fleeing soldiers to get away. Only nine
Kentuckians were killed, a few were wounded, and
the rest escaped to the settlements. As for Colonel
Logan, his gallant conduct, when under stress and fire,
greatly increased his reputation, and at the next gathering
of the Kentucky troops he was unanimously
elected to lead them against the red men, when again
they should need chastising.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>The Indians remained quiescent until the summer
of 1788. Then the frontier was again attacked by
marauding bands, and so destructive was their advance
that the pioneer militia had to be called out.
Colonel Logan was asked to lead the troops against
the enemy.</p>

<p>“Boys, I shall be delighted to do so,” said he.
“But this time there must be perfect discipline and no
retreating. If you break in the same way that you
did in our attack upon the Shawnee town I will not
answer for your scalps. Let us have order, or we will
never succeed.”</p>

<p>“Lead on, Colonel,” cried many. “You have the
right idea, and none of us will go back on you.”</p>

<p>The advance through the wilderness was most successful.
Eight towns were burned, twenty warriors
were killed, and seventy-five prisoners were taken.
The son of a chief named Moluntha was carried off
as a prisoner, and because of his brightness and promise
was kept in Colonel Logan’s family. He was
called Logan, after his distinguished captor, and grew
to be a majestic-looking man, six feet in height.</p>

<p>As for the Colonel, he returned to his farm after
this campaign fully satisfied with his work, and determined
to lead a quiet existence. This he was well
able to do, for the red men had been so signally chastised
that they no longer attempted to rob, burn, and
plunder upon the border. His namesake, however,
came to an untimely end.</p>

<p>During one of the campaigns by General Harrison
against the Maumee Indians, Logan&mdash;the redskin&mdash;was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
dispatched by his superior officer upon a scouting
expedition with several companions. They met a
large force of hostile Indians and were driven in to
their own camp, where one of the white officers was
heard to remark:</p>

<p>“Logan is a treacherous scoundrel. I believe that
he will desert to those of his own color at any moment.”</p>

<p>This was heard by the red man and he was stung
to the quick.</p>

<p>“I shall prove this to be a falsehood,” said he. “I
am true to my white brothers.”</p>

<p>Next morning he started towards the enemy with
some companions and had not gone far when he
found himself in an ambuscade, formed by the famous
chieftain called Winnemac. Logan had the same cool
courage which distinguished his white namesake.</p>

<p>“We are deserting to our enemies, the British,”
said he. “We no longer care to fight with the Americans.
We are at heart your brothers.”</p>

<p>Chief Winnemac grunted, but kept a watchful eye
upon his captives as he carried them away. After the
first day, however, he decided to return the rifles and
other arms to the prisoners. He had counted too
much upon the words of the savage, for Logan had
determined upon escape.</p>

<p>“We will attack our captors to-night,” he whispered
to his two companions, Bright Horn and Captain
Johnny. “There are seven. We will wait until
some leave and will then gain our liberty.”</p>

<p>As he had expected, after the camp-fires had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
lighted, four of the British sympathizers left, in order
to collect fire-wood. They had not been gone over
five minutes before the three captives had fired upon
those left behind, killing all three. They reloaded,
as the others came running to the camp, fired upon
them, and forced them to take refuge behind some
trees. As they stood confronting each other, one of
the most wiry and skillful crept around to the rear
of the American red men, pointed his rifle, and shot
Logan in the shoulder. He fell forward, badly
wounded.</p>

<p>Lifting him to the back of a pony, his friends carried
him to the American camp, where he was placed
upon a litter. Captain Johnny, who had left them
upon the return trip, arrived next morning, bringing
with him the scalp of Chief Winnemac. Logan lingered
for a few days, and then succumbed to his
wound. “I have removed all suspicion upon my
honor,” said he. “Now I am willing to die. My two
sons must be educated by the people of Kentucky.”</p>

<p>Thus perished the namesake of the noble-hearted
Colonel Logan, who helped to clear Kentucky of the
savage tribes, and who soon afterwards rounded out
his life of splendid activity, and died universally lamented.
To such pioneers the state owes a deep debt
of gratitude.</p>

<h2 class="p4">GEORGE ROGERS CLARKE:</h2>

<p class="pch">FAMOUS LEADER OF THE BORDERLAND
OF KENTUCKY</p>

<p class="drop-cap06">ONE of the foremost of the pioneers: one of
the noblest of men: one of the most daring
of fighters: such was George Rogers Clarke
of Virginia. Like Daniel Boone of Kentucky, Clarke
was not only a brave warrior in the rough and ready
armies of the Middle West, but was also a potent
factor in the destinies of the American people.</p>

<p>Born in Albemarle County, Virginia, he early
made his way to Kentucky. At twenty-three we find
him engaged as a surveyor in this virgin land, and
as he was a large and powerful man like George
Washington, he could easily contend with the difficulties
of his profession. So inspiring, in fact, was
his appearance, that he was entrusted with the command
of the militia upon his first visit to the border.
He had a soldierly bearing and a grave and thoughtful
mien.</p>

<p>After remaining for a time in Kentucky, this noble
borderer returned to Virginia in order to settle up
his affairs. He saw that a conflict would soon take
place for the possession of the Middle West between
the Americans, the French, the English&mdash;who had a
chain of forts extending down the Mississippi from
Detroit, Michigan, to Vincennes, Indiana&mdash;and the
redskins. Which party would win? That remained
to be yet settled. Clarke, of course, sided with the
American pioneers who were pressing westward from
Virginia and Tennessee.</p>

<p class="vh"><a name="i087" id="i087">i087</a></p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-087.jpg" width="400" height="415"

     <div class="caption"><p class="pc">GEORGE ROGERS CLARKE.</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>“The Indians,” said he, “are incited to burning,
scalping, and murdering our peaceful settlers upon
the border, by the tongues of the British soldiers, who,
supplying them with food from their forts, are continually
egging them on to rapine and murder. Our
only salvation, as settlers, lies in organization and
military training. We must equip ourselves with
arms and ammunition and must press against them
before they grow so strong that they can crush
us.”</p>

<p>He suggested that the Kentuckians assemble in
convention, and that there they should discuss the
affairs most dear to the hearts of all. To this the
people readily assented, and at this meeting chose
Clarke, himself, and a man named Jones, as delegates
to the Virginia Assembly. They were to go to the
older state and were to ask for five hundred pounds
of gunpowder for purposes of defense against the
redskins.</p>

<p>When they expressed their wants they were met
with a cold reception.</p>

<p>“We will <i>lend</i> you this important supply,” they
were told by those in authority. “But you must guarantee
its repayment and must defray all expenses connected
with its carriage across the mountains.”</p>

<p>Clarke was indignant at these terms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>“This is not the treatment that brave borderers
deserve,” he said. “This should be a free offering
to the men who stand as a breastwork between you
yourselves and the redskins. If you allow your outlying
posts to be swept away by the British and Indians,
then the tide of warfare will roll over your own
settlements, and you will realize&mdash;too late&mdash;the
folly of your refusal.”</p>

<p>To this remonstrance the council replied that they
could not better their offer.</p>

<p>But Clarke was a fighter.</p>

<p>“You do not realize the dangers of your position,”
he again stated to them. “We apply to you for aid
because you are nearest and dearest to us. But&mdash;if
you refuse us&mdash;we can go to New York and there
obtain our supplies. We have pushed into this country.
We have settled it. We are of your own blood.
We claim it. A country which is not worth defending
is not worth claiming.”</p>

<p>This was the way to talk to the hard-headed Virginians.
After an earnest debate it was decided to
recall Clarke and to comply with his request. An
order for five hundred pounds of powder was given
to him. It was to be delivered at Pittsburgh, subject
to his demand, and for use by the borderers of Kentucky.</p>

<p>“I am deeply grateful to you, my brothers,” said
Clarke. “This gift will be well used and my people
will be very thankful to you for it. God bless the
noble settlers of Virginia!”</p>

<p>With a small force of seven men, the daring pioneer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
now went to Fort Pitt for the powder, and carrying
it in canoes, safely transported it to a place called
Limestone, Kentucky. Indians were thick in this
country, and all were hostile. But he came safely
through the wild places and carefully secreted the
powder at various points, where it could be found by
the borderers when needed.</p>

<p>Daniel Boone was now an old man and was so
modest that he refused to thrust himself forward and
become a leader around whom the settlers could rally.
All eyes, therefore, turned to Clarke, whose merits
were now recognized as a gallant fighter and able commander.
The borderers saw that they here had an
unselfish fellow who had their own interests in view,
and who had obtained well-needed assistance for them.
They knew that, without powder, they must be swept
back before the storm of Indian invasion. The time
for a leader had now come, and destiny had sent to the
Kentuckians George Rogers Clarke&mdash;the brave and
the noble.</p>

<p>This soldier now addressed the settlers upon several
occasions and in several different places. He told
them that they must assume an aggressive attitude and
must attack the Indian villages, destroy their crops,
burn their habitations, and teach them the horrors of
invasion.</p>

<p>“We must not wait to be attacked ourselves,” said
he. “We must do the attacking. We must strike
before we are struck, and must hit hard.”</p>

<p>The Kentuckians were stirred by these speeches of
Clarke and swore to follow him to the death.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>“Lead on! Lead on!” cried they. “We will follow
and will do our best to clear the land of our red
enemies.”</p>

<p>This pleased the leader of the borderers, for he saw
that his own spirit animated his men. He therefore
wrote to the Governor of Virginia, telling him of his
plans for border warfare, and requesting aid. Men
and ammunition were sent him. An expedition was
speedily organized at Louisville&mdash;then called the
Falls of the Ohio&mdash;and the border soldiers started
down the stream in boats. At the mouth of the Tennessee
River a party of hunters were met with. From
them Clarke learned that the garrisons at Kaskaskia
and Kahokia were fully aware of his coming and were
quite ready to give his men a hot reception.</p>

<p>“The greater portion of the French,” said the
guides, “prefer American to English rule. You will
find no difficulty in winning them over to your cause.”</p>

<p>These men were taken along as scouts, and, creeping
quietly through the wilderness, they surrounded
and captured Kaskaskia without shedding a drop of
blood. So kind were Clarke’s followers to the inhabitants
that many accompanied them on the march to
Kahokia,&mdash;a town just opposite St. Louis, Missouri.
Both places were populated mainly by people of
French extraction who adhered to the cause of France
in America.</p>

<p>Clarke was a diplomat. Some one has said that
“he eked out the courage of a lion with the cunning
of a fox.” At any rate, he knew enough to make a
firm friend of the parish priest, Monsieur Gerbault,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
who consented to go to Vincennes&mdash;in the absence
of the British commander, who had gone to Detroit&mdash;and
induce the garrison there to embrace the cause
of the Kentuckians. He was successful. After a
lengthy harangue the fort went over to the Americans
and its command was given to a Captain Helm, one
of Clarke’s Lieutenants.</p>

<p>Clarke had accomplished what was thought to be
the impossible. Without any difficulty whatsoever he
had captured three forts and had persuaded all the
inhabitants to join his standard. But these were the
French. There were still the redskinned devils who
would soon be burning, plundering, and massacring
upon the borders. Clarke needed more men. So he
promptly organized the French into militia companies
with which to garrison the captured fort, appointed
French officers to command them, and was thus able
to use all of his Kentucky backwoodsmen in dealing
with the redskins.</p>

<p>The French and Spaniards never asked for peace
from the Indians but always harshly demanded whatever
they might desire. Clarke determined to adopt
their course. This kind of diplomacy is that which
usually wins with the American Indian, for the red
man could never comprehend why the whites would
offer peace if they felt at all certain that they could
accomplish their purpose by means of war. The Indians
never made treaties unless they had met with a
reverse and were in the presence of a superior enemy.
When Clarke <i>demanded</i> like a warrior it suited their
ideas much better than if he had <i>asked</i> like a squaw.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>We now come to the most extraordinary event in
his career: an event which marks him as a man of
courage and capacity. When things were going
against him he managed to turn the tide in his own
favor with remarkable ability.</p>

<p>Braving great dangers and privations, he met the
redskins in their own villages and conferred with
them. Two attempts were made upon his life, but
he escaped all harm and managed to secure a treaty
of peace upon terms which the red men had first
spurned. The treaty was signed and Clarke’s eyes
looked hungrily at Detroit&mdash;the great stronghold
of the British. He had not sufficient men to take
it.</p>

<p>Two detachments from his small army captured a
British post on the upper Wabash, garrisoned by
forty men. This aroused the British to greater activity.
The Kentuckians and French were coming
too near for either pleasure or safety. Besides this,
the savages had begun to waver in their allegiance to
the British flag as they saw the success of the pioneers
from across the Ohio River.</p>

<p>Vincennes, as you know, had gone over to the
Americans, and there was but a small force there of
French militia. Two Americans were in charge: a
Captain Helm and a Mr. Henry. On the fifteenth
day of December, 1778, the English Governor of
Detroit appeared before the town with a large body
of rangers and demanded its surrender. The French
militiamen immediately ran up a white flag.</p>

<p>Hamilton approached the fort, and as he neared it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
was surprised to find himself confronted by a cannon,
behind which stood Captain Helm with a lighted
match in his hand.</p>

<p>“Halt!” cried Hamilton. “My foolish fellow, I
demand your instant surrender!”</p>

<p>“I’ll never surrender,” answered Helm, “until you
settle upon the terms with me.”</p>

<p>“You’ll be allowed to march out with all the honors
of war,” said the British Governor. “And you will
be held a prisoner until exchanged. The militia will
be disarmed and paroled.”</p>

<p>“All right,” answered Captain Helm. “These
terms suit me exactly.”</p>

<p>Imagine the feelings of the good, old Governor.
Instead of seeing a great body of men debouch from
the fort, preceded by a brilliant staff, out marched a
few ragged militiamen headed by Captain Helm, with
one solitary private. It is said that the noble soldier
could not help laughing. At any rate, he felt so well
over the affair that he did not attempt the reduction
of Kaskaskia and Kahokia&mdash;as he should have done&mdash;but
was content to send parties of his men on
forays against the settlements along the Ohio River.
News was soon brought to Clarke of the capture of
Vincennes. The old war-dog was much disconcerted.
Hamilton in possession of Vincennes! It was almost
past belief, yet runners soon came to him from the
frontier, who confirmed the ill tidings. What was
he to do? He had only two hundred men. Hamilton
had three or four times that number. It was the
middle of winter and he was short of all manner of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
supplies. The entire country was flooded. He had
a single flat-bottomed batteau. Should he wait to be
attacked, or should he attempt the seemingly impossible
and endeavor to re-take Vincennes? He answered
the question by turning, one day, to his compatriots,
and saying:</p>

<p>“Whether I stay here or march against Hamilton&mdash;if
I don’t take him, he will take me. By Heaven,
I’ll take him!”</p>

<p>And to this his men cried:</p>

<p>“Lead on! Where you go we will follow!”</p>

<p>Now was such a march as the world had seldom
seen before. The brave and valiant Arnold, who took
his rangers through the depths of the Maine forest
to the attack on Quebec at the outbreak of the American
Revolution, was such a one as this lion-hearted
pioneer. Arnold lost a great many men: Clarke did
not lose any; but the difficulties of the journey were
severe. Through the cold of winter, the chilling rain,
the mud and icy water,&mdash;the latter often three feet
deep,&mdash;marched the Kentucky rangers. They
reached a miserable country called “the drowned
lands,” and for miles were waist-deep in the water.
The way was full of crevasses and mud-holes into
which some of the men sank up to their necks. Clarke
was always in the front, sharing the hardships of his
followers, and outdoing them in the contempt for
peril and suffering. An occasional spot of dry ground&mdash;a
few yards in extent&mdash;was a welcome sight to
the half-drowned rangers. Still they pressed onward
upon their mission.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>“On, boys!” said George Rogers Clarke. “We
will take this post or die in the attempt!”</p>

<p>Splashing forward, the scouts and rangers soon
reached the two branches of the Wabash River. Ordinarily
three miles of solid ground lay between the
two streams. Now there was a continuous sheet of
water before their eyes. The command stopped,
amazed. They had come to an apparently unsurmountable
obstacle. But there were no obstacles to
George Rogers Clarke.</p>

<p>Striding to the front, and holding his rifle aloft in
order to keep the priming dry, he dashed into the
stream. The rest followed with songs and with
cheers. But the chilling water soon made these cease,
for it became an irksome task to breathe. They staggered
with fatigue, but their leader never faltered,
and there was not a man who would have deserted
him. On the seventeenth day of February they reached
the eastern shore of the Wabash and came to the
lowlands of the Embarrass River. It was nine miles
to their goal: the fortress of Vincennes. Every foot
of the way was covered with deep water.</p>

<p>The situation seemed to be desperate. Clarke, however,
was not the one to despair. Taking a canoe,
he made soundings to see if some path might not be
discovered through this inland sea. There seemed to
be none&mdash;the water everywhere reached to his neck.
The men were alarmed. Their faces looked blanched
and pale. Was their march of untold hardships to
end in death by cold and starvation?</p>

<p>A surprising thing now took place. Whispering to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
those nearest to him to follow his example, Clarke
poured some powder into his hand, wet it with water
and blackened his face as a sign that he would succeed,
or die in the attempt. Then&mdash;uttering a loud
whoop&mdash;he dashed into the water. The frontiersmen
gazed wonderingly at him. Then they broke
into song, rushed after him, and made for a ridge of
high ground, which was followed until an island was
reached. Here they camped, but next morning the
ice had formed to the thickness of three-quarters of
an inch. You can well imagine what were their prospects!</p>

<p>But Clarke was never daunted or dismayed. Making
a speech to his half-starved and half-frozen command,
he again plunged into the water.</p>

<p>“We must do or die!” said he. “On to Vincennes!”</p>

<p>With a rousing cheer his followers dashed in after
him&mdash;pushed through the broken ice&mdash;and waded
ahead. The water became more and more deep.
Clarke feared, therefore, that the weaker members of
the party would be drowned. Luckily he had a few
canoeists with him, and these picked up the fainting
ones and carried them to hillocks of dry land. The
strongest were sent forward with instructions to pass
the word back that the water was getting shallow,
and they were told to cry “Land! Land!” when they
got near the woods.</p>

<p>This cheered the drooping spirits of the faint-hearted.
The water <i>never</i> did get shallow. Woodland
was certainly ahead, but when the men reached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
it water was up to their shoulders and they had to
hang to the trees, bushes and logs, until rescued by
the canoes. Some gained the shore in safety, some
were so exhausted when they reached a small island
that they could not climb up the bank and lay half in
and half out of the water. Luck was with them, for
a canoe came down the river in which were some
Indian squaws and their children. They were captured,
and with them was some buffalo meat, tallow,
corn, and cooking utensils. Oh, lucky find! The
weak were now rejuvenated by a hearty meal.</p>

<p>They were upon an island of ten acres. It was
truly an Eden for these half-drowned frontiersmen.
A long rest soon strengthened the weakest, and by
means of the Indian canoe, and a few batteaus which
had been brought with them, they ferried over to
Warrior’s Island, within two miles of Vincennes, and
within plain view of it. Every man feasted his eyes
upon the log fortress and forgot that he had suffered.</p>

<p>Let me here quote from Clarke himself. He says:</p>

<p>“Every man forgot his troubles. It was now that
we had to display our abilities. The plain between us
and the town was perfectly level. The sunken ground
was covered with water full of ducks. We observed
several men out on horseback, shooting them, and
sent out many of our active, young Frenchmen to
decoy and take one prisoner,&mdash;which they did.</p>

<p>“We learned that the British had that evening
completed the wall of the fort, and that there were a
good many Indians in town. Our situation was now
truly critical. There was no possibility of retreat in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
case of defeat, and we were in full view of a town
with six hundred men in it,&mdash;troops, Indians and
inhabitants.</p>

<p>“We were now in the very situation that I had
labored to get ourselves in. The idea of being taken
prisoner was foreign to almost every man, as they
expected nothing but torture. We knew that success
could be secured only by the most daring conduct. I
knew that a number of the inhabitants wished us well:
that the Grand Chief&mdash;Tobacco’s son&mdash;had openly
declared himself a friend of the Big Knives (Americans).
I therefore wrote and sent the following
Placard.</p>


<p class="pch">“TO THE INHABITANTS OF POST
VINCENNES:</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“<span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span>:&mdash;Being now within two miles of
your village with my army, determined to take the
fort this night, and not being willing to surprise you,
I take this method to request such as are true citizens
to remain still in your houses. Those, if any there be,
that are friends to the King, will instantly repair to
the fort, join the ‘Hair buyer’ general, and fight
like men. If any such do not go, and are found afterwards,
they may depend on severe punishment. On
the contrary, those who are true friends to liberty
may depend on being well treated, and I once more
request them to keep out of the streets. Every one
I find in arms on my arrival, I shall treat as an enemy.</p>

<p class="pr4 reduct">“<span class="smcap">G. R. Clarke.</span>”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">This was written by a pioneer general with two
hundred half-starved, half-frozen, and undrilled
troops. Behind the walls of the fort were twice this
number of well-drilled, well-fed, well-clad men. We
can but admire his audacity and impudence. But did
he fulfil his promises to his people at home. And did
he take Hamilton?</p>

<p>The frontiersmen were soon in motion and marched
upon the town. A hill intervened, and when he
reached it, Clarke deployed his men across it several
times. When they would get over, Clarke would
run them around the base to the rear of the knoll&mdash;where
they would be out of sight of the people in the
fort&mdash;and then would march them across again. In
this way he made the inmates of the fortress of Vincennes
believe that he had a much larger force than
was really his. The borderers soon seized all the positions
which commanded the fort and waited until dusk
before beginning the assault. “I fear that they will
know my numbers, if I attack during daylight,” said
the Kentuckian, “and this I do not want them to
know.”</p>

<p>As night began to draw near, the crashing of rifles
awoke the echoes of the forest and the fort was
hotly assailed from every point of vantage. The
Kentuckians were able marksmen and soon silenced
the cannon of the redoubt. No sooner would a porthole
be thrown open than the gunners would be
shot down as they stood. After an hour of such work
the firing ceased, and the garrison was summoned to
surrender.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>Hamilton was dumbfounded at the audacity of the
Kentuckians. He was also much disconcerted by the
actions of one hundred of his redskin allies, who,
seeing the boldness of the frontiersmen, immediately
transferred their allegiance to them and were anxious
to join in the assault upon the post. In spite of
this he refused to surrender.</p>

<p>A far heavier rifle fire was now opened upon the
fort, so that no defender could look out of a porthole
or expose himself in any manner whatsoever,
without being shot down. An assault was determined
upon.</p>

<p>At this juncture a couple of figures emerged from
the principal gateway of Vincennes, bearing a flag of
truce. When the emissaries arrived before Clarke,
they brought word that Hamilton proposed a three
days’ truce and an immediate conference. Clarke did
not wish the British to know his real numbers, so he
declined the truce. But he assented to have a talk
with the English commander, some distance from the
fort, at a place where the Englishman’s eyes could not
see the small numbers of the Kentuckians.</p>

<p>After a long interview nothing came of the pow-wow.
Hamilton asked to march out with all the
honors of war and to be allowed to depart to Detroit,
after giving the assurance that neither he nor his men
would ever again bear arms against the Americans.
Clarke was afraid that the soldiers would not keep
their word and demanded a greater amount of money
and stores than the Britisher was willing to allow him.</p>

<p>“I have sufficient force to take the fort by storm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
at any time I choose,” said Clarke. “Furthermore,
I propose to capture all the detached parties that are
now in the woods and are headed for Vincennes.
Having put them out of the way, I intend to take
the fort at my leisure. I will thus&mdash;at one stroke&mdash;put
an end to all of those people that have been harassing
the American frontier. In case I take you
by storm, I intend to shut my eyes and let my men
do their own pleasure, for such is the treatment that
has been accorded to our own people by the officers
of the Crown.”</p>

<p>The conference broke up, and so terrified was a
Major Hay, who represented the English commander,
that he could scarcely make his way back to Vincennes.
As he wobbled along, a party of redskins&mdash;led by a
white man painted as an Indian&mdash;was seen to approach
the town. The newcomers apparently had no
knowledge that the Kentuckians were foes, for they
walked up as if they were nearing their own people.</p>

<p>When they had approached within a few yards of
the men under Clarke, they were fired upon and two
were killed. Three others were badly wounded. The
remainder&mdash;six in all&mdash;turned in flight, but were
soon taken prisoners. They were tomahawked by the
red allies of the Kentuckians; their bodies were
thrown into the river; and wild war-whoops announced
this fact to the red men in the fort. These
became enraged and frightened when they discovered
that Hamilton was unable to protect them.</p>

<p>Clarke only smiled, for he had hoped that they
would bring on a mutiny within the walls of Vincennes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
and it is exactly what occurred. Seeing that
he was unable to hold the allegiance of his own red
adherents, the once bold Hamilton decided upon capitulation.
On February twenty-fourth a white flag was
displayed over the log walls, and, after a short parley,
a truce was decided upon. The Kentuckians secured
fifty thousand dollars’ worth of military stores. Besides
this they detached the Indians from the English
and took away from the Britons the entire northeast
territory, which would otherwise have been held
by them when peace was concluded. Clarke, with his
two hundred raw Kentucky riflemen, had won a notable
victory.</p>

<p>Think of it! The long march, the terrible rivers of
frozen ice, the lack of proper food, the toilsome journey
through deep forests! Then the cheek and gall
of that saucy message to Hamilton, safe in a strong
fortress with twice the number of men as those half-frozen
backwoodsmen outside! Then the daring attack,
the wonderful accuracy of the rifle fire, and the
final victory! Such men were heroes. Whether your
sympathies be with Kentuckian or Britisher, you must
admit it, and you must&mdash;I own&mdash;take off your hat
to Clarke: the twenty-seven year old leader of this
gallant band.</p>

<p>But what of the subsequent career of this wonderfully
successful man? Alas! What we know of his
thereafter does not abound to his credit. To the
enthusiasm of youth he joined the daring ambition of
the born soldier: never satisfied. Always anxious to
move forward and on, he asked the Kentucky Assembly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
for men and agreed to capture Detroit; to destroy
the English power for all time; and to prevent further
combination of unfriendly tribes of red men.
He was promised both soldiers and ammunition, but
they never came. It is said that in disgust at his
forced inaction he took to drink for relief from his
worries. He became dissipated, morbid, and a recluse.</p>

<p>For some time he rested in inactivity near the Falls
of the Ohio, and about the year 1780 built Fort Jefferson
on the Mississippi. He then journeyed to
Richmond, Virginia, in order to appeal in person for
the necessary means for taking Detroit. His plans
were thought well of and were approved. But the
measure never passed the legislature. Before it could
be put into effect he was appointed to command a body
of troops who were to check the aggressive operations
of Benedict Arnold. He was made a Brigadier-General
and was authorized to collect a large force,
which was to meet at Louisville (the Falls of the
Ohio) and was to fall upon Detroit and destroy this
strong citadel of British authority.</p>

<p>Misfortune seemed to follow upon his footsteps.
The force was never collected and the projected campaign
had to be abandoned. He and his men had
several brushes with marauding bands of Ohio Indians,
and in 1782 took part in the unfortunate battle
of Blue Licks, in Kentucky. Rallying a detachment
of one thousand men, Clarke invaded the Indian towns,
but the savages fled from their villages and scattered,
so that there was no one to fight when the borderers
entered. Fortune had forsaken George Rogers Clarke,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
and, although in 1786 he led another expedition of
one thousand men against the Indians on the Wabash
River, it resulted in an absolute failure. His followers
were mutinous. The campaign had to be abandoned.
The hero who could inspire a march of two
hundred miles through half-frozen forests had lost his
former magnetism. He had begun to go down hill.</p>

<p>Dispirited, somewhat broken in health, and faint-hearted,
the bold frontiersman sought the seclusion of
his hut near the Ohio River. Here, he was offered and
accepted a commission in the French armies west of
the Mississippi, for this land was then under the lilies
of France. An expedition was about to be made
against the Spaniards upon the lower reaches of the
river, but a revolution in France overturned the party
in power and destroyed all the plans of those in America.
Clarke was soon no longer Major General, and,
forced to a life of inactivity, he returned to an isolated
and lonely existence in his log hut. At forty
years of age he was a prematurely old man, and in
1817 he died at Louisville, Kentucky: a town which
was growing rapidly in size and which had been the
scene of many of his early triumphs. Exposure and
neglect of the proper laws of living had done their
work.</p>

<p>George Rogers Clarke was a remarkable man. As
a youngster he was brimful of enthusiasm, of vigor,
of magnetism. He carried an expedition through to
success in the face of fearful obstacles. Had he shown
the white feather for an instant he would have met
with ignominious failure. His courage, his cheerfulness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
his optimism impelled him on to victory. Had
he been able to govern his appetite for liquor he would
have been a man of splendid usefulness in his later
years. His collapse at the early age of forty is full
witness to the deplorable effects of the inability of a
strong man to curb his passions. One can but look
upon his career with sadness and regret.</p>

<h2 class="p4">JOHN SLOVER:</h2>

<p class="pch">SCOUT UNDER CRAWFORD AND HERO
OF EXTRAORDINARY ADVENTURES</p>

<p class="drop-cap02">TWO red men paddled down the White River,
far in the western portion of the state of
Virginia, one bright morning in the month
of May, 1765. As they rounded a bend in the stream,
before them was a little trapper’s son, apparently with
no one with him. He was throwing pebbles into the
water and was laughing as they splashed upon the surface
of the stream.</p>

<p>“How!” grunted one of the braves. “I like to
have young paleface in my lodge. I make him take
the place of my own papoose, whom the Great Spirit
has stolen from me.”</p>

<p>“You can get him,” suggested the other. “Come
on, let us paddle towards the little one and capture
him.”</p>

<p>As the redskins approached, the boy looked at them
with no sign of fear, and laughed at their solemn-looking
faces. But they did not laugh. Instead of
this, the one in the bow leaped upon the shore, seized
the youngster, and carried him to the canoe, where
he was bound by deer thongs and was quickly paddled
down stream. His parents looked for him in vain
that evening, and for many evenings, but their little
son never returned. Thus John Slover became a ward
of the redskins.</p>

<p class="vh"><a name="i109" id="i109">i109</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>The Indians were then living at Sandusky, upon
the Ohio River, and here the little white boy grew
up to be a man. Adopted by the Miami tribe, he
learned to love their ways, to live the wild, roving
life as a trapper and hunter, and to be more at home
in the forest than in the houses of those of his own
race. In the autumn of 1773, a treaty was made at
Pittsburg, Pennsylvania, between the Miamis and the
whites, and at this place was a big gathering of the
savages and frontiersmen, with their families. Jack
Slover was interested in the affair and hung around
the clusters of talkers, who were eagerly discussing
the terms of the articles of agreement.</p>

<p>“Hello!” came a voice, as he was near one animated
group. “If this isn’t little Jack Slover grown
to be a man! Turn around, son, and see if you don’t
recognize me.”</p>

<p>The adopted ward of the Miamis spun about upon
his heel, and there saw a raw-boned trapper, who was
gazing at him with an inquiring eye.</p>

<p>“I certainly do not recognize you,” he replied.
“Who are you, anyway?”</p>

<p>The young fellow knew of his kidnapping, when
a small boy, but had never cared to go back to his own
people.</p>

<p>The frontiersman now seized him by the shoulders.
“Why, I’m your father’s brother, Tom Slover! I
saw that you were not a Miami the minute I looked
at you, and I found out that you had been captured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
many years ago by the Indians. Upon closer inspection
it was easy to perceive that you were my brother’s
son. My boy, we have been waiting to find you for
years. You will now come back to us, won’t you?”</p>

<p>Young Slover hung his head, for he was loath to
part from the friends and companions of his youth.
He was on the point of refusing, but, just then, another
frontiersman approached who announced that
he was his father. The meeting between son and
parent was not demonstrative; in fact, the youth
rather drew away from his own flesh and blood.
Soon, however, he became more reconciled, and, after
an hour’s conversation, agreed to accompany his kinsmen
to their home in Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>The conference was soon over, both Indians and
whites were agreed upon the terms of the treaty, and
the captured son of the pioneer went back to his own
country, where he seemed to be contentedly abiding
at the outbreak of the American Revolution. He was
one of the first to enlist, and, because of his experience
in woodcraft, was made a sharpshooter. In this
branch of the service he did good work, and was honorably
discharged at the close of the struggle with
the Mother Country.</p>

<p>Some years after the Revolutionary War&mdash;in 1782&mdash;the
redskins of the Middle West became very bold,
and made frequent incursions upon the white settlements
of Ohio, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia.
Prompt vengeance was demanded by the pioneers who
had penetrated into the wilderness and had there built<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
their homes. An expedition was determined upon,
and Colonel William Crawford&mdash;a brave officer of
the Revolutionary War&mdash;was selected as its commander.
The time and place of rendezvous were
fixed for May 20th, 1782, at a point on the western
shore of the Ohio, forty miles above Fort Pitt. There
were four hundred and fifty volunteers; among them
an accomplished surgeon, Dr. Knight.</p>

<p>Just before the expedition got under way, Colonel
Crawford approached Slover, and said:</p>

<p>“My good friend, we are in need of a scout and
guide upon our expedition. You know this country
like a book, so I would like to engage you as one of
our forerunners and assistants. Will you go with
us?”</p>

<p>The adopted ward of the Miamis was reluctant to
accept.</p>

<p>“I have lived with these Indians whom you intend
to attack,” said he. “I have slept with them; hunted
with them; have eaten with them. Surely you would
not have me turn upon all of my old friends?”</p>

<p>The Colonel smiled.</p>

<p>“Yes, but what sort of friends?” he answered.
“Here they have been murdering innocent women
and children. Have been burning homes, killing cattle
and horses. They have been subjecting their prisoners
to horrible tortures. You are too much of a
man not to appreciate the need of checking these onslaughts
upon our people.”</p>

<p>“The whites are gradually encroaching upon their
lands,&mdash;the lands which they believe that the Great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
Spirit has given to them,” replied Slover, in a deliberate
tone. “Can you blame them for resenting these
advances? They are children, too, of the wilderness
and they fight like the wild beasts who surround
them.”</p>

<p>“Then you refuse to accompany us?”</p>

<p>“No, not so. Upon thinking over the matter, I
believe that it is impossible for the two races to live
side by side, unless one race is supreme. That the
whites will overrun the country is only too evident. I
will go with you, for I certainly do not approve of
the manner in which they have conducted their warfare,
and I believe that they must be punished.”</p>

<p>The march was soon commenced, but, in a few
days, some of the volunteers broke ranks and started
for their homes. It was impossible to hold them.
Further signs of insubordination were soon in evidence,
some of the men demanding that they be sent
back to their cabins, declaring that their horses were
jaded and that their provisions were almost exhausted.
Not long afterwards two skulking Indians were seen
spying upon the advance. They were fired upon, but
escaped. It was now evident that all secrecy was out
of the question. The men grew mutinous and were
so unruly that the officers requested them to continue
for only one day longer, and then if no Indians were
found they were to return. This was being discussed
when one of the advance pickets dashed in, crying out:
“The Indians are ahead of us about a mile. They
are drawn up in the timber and are waiting for us!”</p>

<p>At this news a loud whoop came from the lusty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
throats of the frontiersmen, and they discontinued
their complaints. Priming their rifles and fingering
their powder-horns, they pressed forward to the attack,
while their leader, Crawford, who had fine military
judgment, saw that the enemy had seized a position
of great strength, from which they must be driven
at once. He therefore urged on his men to the charge.</p>

<p>As the order came, the pioneers dismounted and
rushed boldly upon the redskins in front and upon the
flanks, hunting them from the woods, across an open
field, and into some dense forest-land in the rear.
Here the savages were heavily reinforced, and Crawford’s
Rangers were almost driven from the timber by
the wily braves, who were now fighting from every
bush, stump, hillock and tree. The battle waged with
great fury until dark, when the savages withdrew,
and the trappers slept upon the ground, ready to resume
the affair in the morning.</p>

<p>As daylight appeared the battle was renewed at
long range, neither side being anxious for a hand-to-hand
engagement. It was plainly evident that the
Indians were constantly being reinforced. Their
whooping and yelling grew more and more derisive,
and they began to extend their lines so as to flank the
men of the frontier. For this reason, the officers
decided upon a retreat.</p>

<p>Slover, the scout, was far over to the right, watching
some horses, and no news of the intended movement
was brought to him. Soon the uproar of retreat
came to his ears and warned him of his danger. He
therefore selected the finest horse among those under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
his charge, mounted it, and fled after his comrades,
who became rapidly disorganized. The red men fired
a volley in the direction of the frontiersmen, at which
one of the Crawford Rangers shouted: “The enemy
have found out our design! Save yourselves! Save
yourselves!”</p>

<p>Panic now became general, and so great was the
disorder that it was plainly heard in the lines of the
Indians, among whom was the famous renegade,
Simon Girty. “Out, men,” he cried, “and pick up
the stragglers, for these Americans have whipped
themselves!”</p>

<p>Those who had been wounded were dropped at the
beginning of the rout and were speedily dispatched
by the tomahawks of the savages. The rest fled in
whatever way they could, without semblance of order
or discipline, and, as they ran helter-skelter through
the forest, were pursued by the exultant redskins with
wild and blood-curdling whooping. Slover galloped
along with some difficulty, as the ground was very
rough, and soon found further obstructions in his path,
for a wide bog lay before him, which extended for
a great distance in either direction.</p>

<p>Some of the fugitives were unable to get across the
bog on foot, but Slover and a few others were able
to cross on their horses. As they fled on through the
darkness of night, behind them echoed the horrid yells
of the savages, the rifle shots of the whites, and the
shrieks of the wounded. Six fugitives joined the fleeing
scout, two of whom had lost their rifles, and, as
the Indians were pressing them furiously, they headed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
for the settlement of Detroit, hoping to elude the
red men as they went. They ran into another portion
of the swamp a few hours later, and halted there for
a slight repast of cold pork and corn bread&mdash;of which
they had a small supply in their haversacks.</p>

<p>As they were seated upon some stumps, and were
munching their repast, they were startled by an Indian
whoop very close at hand.</p>

<p>“We are discovered,” whispered Slover. “Hide
yourselves, my men, in the tall grass.”</p>

<p>Not many moments afterwards, a band of Shawnees
passed by, laughing and talking among themselves,
apparently with no idea that the pioneers were
near. They were well satisfied with the signal defeat
which they had administered to Crawford and his
men; had many scalps and much plunder. When
they were gone, Slover and his companions continued
on their way, entering upon a sea of waving grass,
which made it evident that any skulking red men
would soon discover their whereabouts.</p>

<p>Silently they plodded across the prairie, but suddenly
the man in advance called their attention to the
fact that some moving objects were approaching.</p>

<p>“Lie low, boys!” he shouted. “I think that a
crowd of redskins are just in front of us.”</p>

<p>He was right, and, as they hid in the tall grass, a
troop of Indians passed by, moving rapidly and noisily
along. Fortunately the red men did not discover
their trail, and with great shouting and singing had
soon walked out of hearing. The trappers arose, continued
their flight, and kept a sharp lookout for enemies.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
They were soon to meet with more children of
the forest.</p>

<p>Two of the fugitives now became very lame and
were unable to keep up with the rest of the party. One
had a bad attack of rheumatism; so bad, in fact, that
he fell way behind the rest and did not come up,
although they whistled, called, and strove to attract
his attention in every possible way, in spite of the
danger of being discovered by lurking redskins. They
finally went on without him, and gave him up for lost.
He at length reached Wheeling in safety, having
passed through many dangers and hairbreadth escapes
from capture by roving Indians.</p>

<p>Slover and his friend were hurrying towards the
settlements, and naturally left a well-defined trail
behind them. This was followed for several days by a
band of Shawnees, who finally decided that the whites
would be easy to capture and decided to ambush them.</p>

<p>This they did, and, as the frontiersmen were quietly
passing between some high bluffs, a volley rang out
from either side and two of their number fell dead.
The rest sprang immediately to the shelter of trees,
where Slover took aim at one of the Indians who
could be seen raising his hand.</p>

<p>“Do not fire,” said he, in excellent English. “If
you surrender to us, you will be well treated. We
will take you to our houses and will allow you to leave,
in a short time, for your own people.”</p>

<p>Slover and two of the frontiersmen gave themselves
up immediately, but a young fellow named John Paul
refused to do so, and, rushing to the rear, managed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
to get away. The redskins peppered the air with bullets,
but none hit the fugitive and he got safely beyond
range. After a long and arduous trip through the
wilderness, he at length reached the frontier settlement
at Wheeling, West Virginia.</p>

<p>As John Slover and his companions were being
taken along by the Indians, one of them recognized
him as the young paleface who had been brought up
by the Miamis.</p>

<p>“You no good, Mannuchcothe,” said he. “You
fight against your own brothers. You kill your own
people. Ugh! Ugh! We fix you for this.”</p>

<p>John Slover began to think that perhaps what the
savages had promised was not to take place, and when
once they came in sight of their town, their whole
demeanor changed. They began to howl and cry out:</p>

<p>“You are some of those who wish to drive us from
our country. Death to you! Death to you!”</p>

<p>The squaws, warriors, and children came running
to meet the captives and began to whip and beat them.
Then they took the oldest of the frontiersmen and
blackened his face with charred sticks.</p>

<p>“Are they going to burn me, Slover?” the poor
fellow gasped.</p>

<p>“Do not answer, Mannuchcothe!” shouted the Indians.
“Do not answer! We will not hurt him! We
will adopt him!”</p>

<p>The red men now took the prisoners to Waughcotomoco,
another of their towns, about two miles off,
but sent a runner in advance to announce their coming.
As the captives came in sight of it they saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
hundreds of Indians in a double line, ready to make
them run the gauntlet. This they did, and although
Slover got through safely, the frontiersman whose
face had been blackened, was knocked down, kicked,
beaten, and shot full of arrows. He reached the council
chamber, where he thought that he would be safe,
and, although he seized one of the posts with both
hands, he was torn away from it and was soon dispatched
with a tomahawk.</p>

<p>Slover, meanwhile, was left alone, but he had no
cheerful thoughts, for before him lay the bodies of
Harold, the son of Crawford, the American leader;
of a Colonel Harrison; and of several other prominent
soldiers of the American army. They had all
been killed during the retreat. His remaining companion
was led away to another town and was never
again heard of; while the gallant scout, himself, was
now confronted by a young Miami buck, who said in
the Indian language:</p>

<p>“Mannuchcothe, you must come before a council
and must explain to the old men why you deserted our
tribe. Mannuchcothe, it will go ill with you.”</p>

<p>The sharpshooter did not worry, for he did not
believe that his old friends would go back on him.
In this he was correct, for there seemed to be no great
amount of malice towards the ex-Miami, until the appearance
of a white renegade&mdash;James Girty&mdash;the
brother of the famous Simon. This scoundrel made
an impassioned speech, in which he said:</p>

<p>“My Indian brethren, this white captive should
suffer death. For not only has he deserted you for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
your enemies&mdash;the palefaces&mdash;but when I asked
him how he would like to live with you again, he told
me that he would care to remain only long enough to
take a scalp and then escape. He is your enemy at
heart and has even now been fighting against you.
Death, and torture before death, would not be too
severe for him.”</p>

<p>The scout was outraged and angered by these remarks.</p>

<p>“What you say is not true,” he replied. “I have
never in my life made the statement that I would only
remain long enough with my red brethren to take a
scalp and then escape. I entered this war with reluctance,
and I had not fired a shot up to the time that
I was captured by my old companions. I am a friend
of the Miamis and always will be their friend.”</p>

<p>To these remarks the red men grunted an assent
and allowed him to move, unbound, around the village.
He was assigned to a lodge with an old squaw,
who became very much attached to him, and, not
many days afterwards, came to him and said:&mdash;</p>

<p>“That James Girty is influencing my brothers
against you. If you have a chance to escape, you
must do so, for I fear that they intend to put you out
of the way.”</p>

<p>Not long afterwards a council of Shawnee, Wyandot,
Delaware, Chippewa, Miami, and Mingo braves
decided that Slover had been untrue to their race, and
that he must suffer punishment and death. Two warriors
appeared before his wigwam in order to carry
him away, but the old squaw covered him with her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
blanket and said that he should not go. When the
two bucks endeavored to enter, she threw a pot of
boiling water at them.</p>

<p>This was too much for the warriors, who retreated
before the scalding fluid, but they soon returned with
James Girty and forty Indians, who overpowered the
fighting squaw. Slover was seized, bound, and his
body was painted black. This was a sign that he was
to be tortured and eventually killed.</p>

<p>Five miles from Waughcotomoco was another Indian
town, to which the scout was marched. A vast
number of red men greeted his coming with fierce
cheering, and formed in two lines in order to make
him run the gauntlet. As he raced between them, they
struck him with clubs, with spears, and with their
hands. In spite of this he was not badly hurt and
could walk without assistance to another small town,
two miles further on, where&mdash;in an unfinished council
house&mdash;he was fastened to a stake. Brush was
piled around his feet and this was lighted for his
torture. “I will meet death like a brave man,” said
Slover to himself. Then, turning to the Indians, he
cried out: “You shall rue the day that ever you put
an end to John Slover. My white brothers will
avenge me a hundredfold.”</p>

<p>An Indian orator arose, and, with a fierce and vindictive
speech, sought to fan the flame of the red
men’s passions to the highest pitch.</p>

<p>“How! How!” cried many voices.” It is well
that the white man should die. How! How!”</p>

<p>Slover glowered upon the yelling mob as the crackling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
flames began to creep nearer to his feet. But
now an unexpected interposition of nature occurred,
which was greatly in the victim’s favor.</p>

<p>A high wind arose; dense, black clouds covered the
sky; the growling of thunder drowned the words of
the orator and the yelling of his hearers. A sheet of
rain burst upon the fire at the stake, extinguishing
it completely, and Slover saw the Indians scatter to
the cover of their wigwams, where they called out
to him:</p>

<p>“We will burn you to-morrow. The Great Spirit
has helped you, but he cannot save you.”</p>

<p>The shower lasted for over an hour, and when it
had concluded the red men gathered around the stake,
where they beat and kicked their captive until eleven
o’clock at night. Then a brave called Half Moon
asked him if he did not want to go to sleep.</p>

<p>“I am exhausted,” replied the scout. “If you intend
to kill me to-morrow, loosen my bonds and let
me rest.”</p>

<p>Half Moon untied the strands which bound the
weakened frontiersman, carried him to a log hut, and
there bound him to a pole in the centre, with deer
thongs which cut tightly into his flesh. A rope was
placed about his neck and was tied to a rafter of the
house. Three guards were placed to watch him, and,
as Half Moon departed, he said:</p>

<p>“Get a good sleep, paleface. You will need it, for
to-morrow you will eat fire. This is what comes to
you for fighting against your own people.”</p>

<p>The scout had not yet lost all hope of making his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
escape, and carefully considered the possibility of
getting away. Two of his guards were soon asleep;
the third (an aged brave) smoked a long, clay pipe
and told him that he had seen many palefaces tortured
at the stake. “Some weep like squaws,” said
he. “Others bear it like men. You have once been
a redskin and should be able to stand the fire without
crying. You should come through without a bit
of trouble.”</p>

<p>On and on he thus rambled until he became worn
out&mdash;his head dropped upon his breast&mdash;and he
began to snore loudly. As the noise of his heavy
breathing came to the ears of the scout, he began to
work vigorously at his bonds. By wriggling, tugging,
and pulling, at last his hands were free. He
reached for the thong about his neck and began to
chew it with his teeth.</p>

<p>As he turned and twisted in an endeavor to free
himself from this remaining bond, day began to break
and the pale light of dawn flooded the cabin. The
talkative old Indian awoke; yawned; stretched; and
looked around at the captive; but Slover clasped his
hands behind his back as if they were still tied, and
stood perfectly still. The red man turned over upon
his side and again composed himself in sleep. It was
now or never with the captured frontiersman.</p>

<p class="vh"><a name="i125" id="i125">i125</a></p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>Again seizing upon the rope, Slover gave it a few
strong jerks, and, biting it with his jaws for a second
time, suddenly parted it. With his heart bumping
against his side like a trip-hammer, he stole noiselessly
from the lodge. Not an Indian was stirring,
and, darting toward a corn field, he narrowly missed
stepping upon a squaw with her two children, who
were asleep beneath a tree. He crept through the
growing stalks, and upon the other side saw quite a
number of ponies. Taking the rope from his arm, he
made a slip-noose of it; selected a fine, young horse;
threw it over his head; mounted, and rode away like
mad. His life depended upon his exertions.</p>

<p>As he dashed off, he heard a door open in an Indian
lodge and knew that the red men were astir. They
would soon discover his absence. He would be followed
by all of the swiftest and hardest-riding men
of the encampment. No wonder that he dug his
heels into the flanks of his pony and urged him to do
his very best.</p>

<p>At ten o’clock he reached the Scioto River,&mdash;now
much swollen by the recent thunder shower. But his
horse was winded and he had to stop in order to give
him both water and breath, for he was blowing from
his exertions. He plunged into the stream, crossed it,
and continued his flight at the fastest pace which his
horse was able to make. Finally the faithful animal
began to pant and stagger. He was done for.</p>

<p>As the Indian pony fell upon his side, Slover leaped
to the ground and heard a wild yelping behind him
in the forest. He thus knew that the Indians were
hot upon his trail. The horse had carried him seventy
miles at a fast pace, which is extraordinary. But
the animal was now lying prostrate, with the glaze
of death showing in his eye. He had run a good race.</p>

<p>The scout bounded forward, loping through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
underbrush, timber, and tall grass, and leaving as
little trail as he could. But his exertions were wearing
heavily upon him, and, about ten o’clock that
night, he fell exhausted to the ground. He lay in a
stupor for two hours.</p>

<p>When he was again able to move, a full moon cast
its silvery light over the dense woodland, where he
had fallen, and no sound broke the stillness of the
night save the weird call of a whippoorwill. The redskins
could easily have captured him had they been
close upon his track, but his care in leaving little trace
of his flight had thrown them from the pursuit.
Breathing more easily, he again continued his race for
life, and, as day came, abandoned his trail for a low,
rough ridge, where was little grass or soft earth. On,
on, he continued, occasionally stopping to listen at the
sounds of the forest, but, except for the occasional
call of a bird, no voice came to his expectant hearing.
The red men had lost heart and had returned to their
wigwams.</p>

<p>As evening came, the frontiersman reached the
banks of one of the creeks which empty into the
Muskingum, and again sank exhausted to the earth.
The mosquitoes swarmed upon him, biting him unmercifully,
and as his hunting suit (which the red
men had allowed him to put on when tied) was torn
to tatters by the nettles and briars, they had a splendid
opportunity to get at his bare flesh. Some wild
berries furnished him with much-needed food,&mdash;the
first he had eaten since his escape,&mdash;and, if we are
to believe his word for it, he says that he was so terrified<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
with fear, that he had forgotten to feel hungry
during his flight. “I was fairly peeled from head to
foot by briars and mosquitoes,” he has written. “And
I was now so hungry that I fell upon two crawfish
which I found behind a rock in the Muskingum, and
ate them raw.”</p>

<p>The scout was now refreshed, and plunging into the
Muskingum, swam to the other shore. Two days
later he reached the Ohio River, opposite Wheeling,
West Virginia, and seeing a man in a skiff who was
apparently fishing, called out to him in a loud voice:</p>

<p>“Hallo! Hallo! Comrade! I’m a fugitive from
the Indians and was one of Crawford’s men. Come!
Take me over to the settlement!”</p>

<p>The fellow did not seem anxious to hasten to his
relief, for he was afraid that Slover was one of the
white renegades who had joined the redskins and was
anxious to trap him. After a long harangue he finally
rowed to the place where the tattered scout was
standing. The refugee fairly hugged him for joy,
and, in a few minutes, was again safe in the settlement,
where he was greeted with warm and affectionate
regard by the other men of the frontier, who had
received many stragglers from the ill-fated expedition
under Colonel Crawford.</p>

<p>The escape of John Slover was one of the narrowest
of which there is any record in the annals of war
upon the frontier. No wonder that for many years
the story of this famous affair was the favorite topic
of conversation, when the after-dinner pipes were
lighted, and the men of the forest would sit before the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
glowing embers, there to tell tales concerning the
heroism and courage of the gallant settlers of the wild
and undeveloped West. Truly the adventures which
befell John Slover were the most thrilling of them all.</p>

<div class="break">

<h2 class="p4">LEWIS WETZEL:</h2>

<p class="pch">HEROIC VIRGINIA FRONTIERSMAN AND
IMPLACABLE ENEMY OF THE
REDSKINS</p>

<p class="drop-cap06">“BOYS, watch your mother and grandfather for
a few hours, because I am going out fishing.
There is no danger of attack from redskins,
for none have been seen for six months. If, however,
any one comes to our cabin with news of prowling
bands, shoot off your rifles three times. This will
warn me of any danger to you, and I will hasten
home.”</p>

<p>So spoke John Wetzel, whose cabin was upon the
far western Virginian frontier, and, turning from his
two little boys, he plunged into the wilderness. This
was the last that he ever saw of his wife and her aged
father. He had not been three days in the forest
before his cabin was attacked.</p>

<p>Stealing carefully through the brush, a marauding
band of savages suddenly made a sortie upon the isolated
house of logs. There was not time to warn the
inmates of the stealthy approach before the tomahawk
and scalping-knife were at work. In an hour’s time
all of the inmates had been dispatched, except Lewis
Wetzel and his little brother, Martin, both of whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
were carried off into captivity. Lewis was about thirteen
years of age and Martin was eleven.</p>

<p>“We will soon escape,” whispered the older youth.
“Wait until evening arrives and then I will show you
how to creep away from these horrible savages.”</p>

<p>Lewis had been severely wounded by an arrow, but
he stoically bore the pain, and trudged behind his captors
with no show of ill humor. The Indian prisoner
who lagged, or who made a cry of distress, would be
speedily dispatched by the savages, and this he knew.
The other boy went bravely ahead and said nothing.</p>

<p>Through the wilderness walked the red men, and
on the night of the second day they camped twenty
miles beyond the Ohio River.</p>

<p>“Ugh!” spoke a brave. “These children cannot
escape us now. We will not bind them with thongs
this evening, but will allow them to go free.”</p>

<p>The savages had underestimated the daring courage
which was in the heart of Lewis Wetzel. No sooner
were the red men fast asleep, when, touching his
brother with his hand, Lewis warned him to keep absolutely
silent and to follow him away into the darkness.
They were barefoot.</p>

<p>“It is impossible for us to escape without moccasins,”
said Lewis, after they had gone some distance.
“This ground is full of stones, and our feet will be
ruined. You wait here for me and I will return to
the camp and get a pair for each of us, and then we
can easily travel through the wilderness.”</p>

<p>The brave boy not only secured the moccasins but
also returned with a gun and some ammunition. Then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
on they plunged through the forest. Just as the first
streaks of dawn began to light up the gloomy depths,
behind them echoed the shouts of their enemies, the
red men.</p>

<p>“Walk backward upon your trail, brother,” said
Lewis Wetzel. “Then turn to the right and secrete
yourself in the dense undergrowth. These red men
will soon catch up to us and we must be thoroughly
hidden.”</p>

<p>This advice was followed, and it was well, for the
boys had lain in the covert but a few minutes when
their captors came bounding past. They were yelling
to each other and were furious with anger at having
lost their prisoners. The two Wetzels waited until
they were out of sight. When the yelping had ceased
they crept from their hiding-place and ran away to
the right. In a few hours they heard the Indians
again returning, and, secreting themselves in some underbrush,
saw some savages dash by on ponies. They
were not the same red men whom they had first seen,
but these, also, could not find them. When the redskins
were well beyond hearing, the terrified children
ran to the river, fastened two logs together, and succeeded
in crossing it. Not long afterwards they
reached the house of a frontiersman and knew that
they were safe. When they told him their story, he
showed great surprise.</p>

<p>“Bully for you, boys!” cried the man of the clearing.
“You, Lewis, showed particular courage and
daring. You are a credit to your poor father, who
is, I hear, terribly overcome by this butchery of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
redskins. I trust that you will both live long and
useful lives upon the border.”</p>

<p>“Thank you!” cried the boys. “We will do our
best, anyway, to avenge the terrible injury which the
red men have inflicted upon our family.”</p>

<p>Thus early was implanted in the breasts of the two
Wetzels an implacable hatred for the savages.</p>

<p>It is said that Lewis was the strongest and most
active of all of the youths upon the western borderland
of Virginia, and by long practice had gained the
ability to load his rifle while running at full speed.
This was an immense advantage to him in his numerous
affrays with the red men.</p>

<p>Not long after the terrible defeat of Colonel Crawford,
in which John Slover was a participant, a pioneer
named Thomas Mills arrived at Wheeling, West
Virginia, where Lewis Wetzel was temporarily residing.</p>

<p>“I have left my good horse at Indian Spring, some
five miles away,” said he. “The country was so
rough that I could not ride him here, for some redskins
were upon my trail. Wetzel, I wish that you
would accompany me to where he is, for I want to
be able to hold my own with the savages, should we
meet any of them.”</p>

<p>“Mills, I’m your man,” said Wetzel. So, upon the
day following, they were on their way towards the
spring.</p>

<p>When they arrived at the place where Mills had left
his horse, they found the animal tied to a bush.</p>

<p>“That looks mighty suspicious,” whispered Wetzel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
to his companion, “because I understand that you
left him untied. Do not go near the animal until I
circle around him and see if any savages are in our
front.”</p>

<p>The pioneer, however, neglected to heed this sage
counsel and proceeded to untie the pony. As he
reached down towards the bridle-rein, the head of an
Indian appeared from behind a rock.</p>

<p>“Mills! Mills! Take to a tree!” yelled the scout.
“There’s a redskin drawin’ er bead on yer!”</p>

<p>The warning was unheeded. The frontiersman continued
to work on the bridle-reins; then a sharp crack
was heard, and the red man fell back, shot through
the forehead by Wetzel. At the same moment a series
of quick reports came from the brush, and Mills sank
to the ground, pierced by a half dozen bullets.</p>

<p>Wetzel started away on the run, for a number of
top-knots rose from the bushes. Their owners hastened
after him, but were uncautious enough to drop
their own guns so that they could run all the faster.
Knowing that he had discharged his piece, they expected
to soon overtake him, tie his hands behind his
back, and remove him to their own camp, to run the
gauntlet and be tortured. They had counted without
their host.</p>

<p>The lithe and sinewy trapper raced onward, exerting
his utmost speed, and, finding that he could not
get away from his pursuers, turned about and fired
upon the nearest red man. The art of loading upon
the run, which he had learned, was of tremendous
assistance to him, for he was thus able to place a bullet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
in his adversary’s chest, which stretched him upon
the ground. Again he started forward, loading as he
ran, and, turning a second time, was about to fire,
when his nearest pursuer seized the muzzle of his rifle.</p>

<p>“Hah! Paleface! I have you!” cried the red man,
for he had often been to the settlements and had
learned how to speak excellent English.</p>

<p>“Not yet,” answered the trapper, and he grappled
with his antagonist. They were very evenly matched.
By the greatest exertion, the white man succeeded in
wresting the redskin’s hold from his rifle, and in
shooting him dead. It was a short struggle, but during
it two Indians gained upon the man of the frontier,
so that they were very close indeed. He now
turned and ran as fast as he was able&mdash;loading as he
went.</p>

<p>The Indians were whooping wildly, but they had
knowledge of his skill in loading on the run. When
he turned again in order to fire, they took hasty departure
to the shelter of some large trees. He kept
on going&mdash;the red men still after him. But he was
a crafty fellow, as the following will show:</p>

<p>Having reached a clearing in the forest, he purposely
stumbled and fell, as if exhausted by his race
for life. The redskins thought that they now had
him. They bounded forward with exultant shouts,
but as they came nearer, the bold trapper rolled upon
his side, raised his rifle, and brought one of them to
the earth before he could get behind a tree. The
second Indian turned and fled as fast as he was able,
howling out in loud tones:</p>

<p>“No catch dat feller. No catch him at all. He
gun always loaded. He devil with the shooting stick.”</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>At this the crafty trapper rose to his feet with a
loud guffaw.</p>

<p>“These redskins have yet to learn a trick or two,”
said he, chuckling. “They should remember that
some trappers can load their rifles when on the run.
My fine fellows&mdash;Au revoir!”</p>

<p>So saying, he started upon his way to the settlements,
lighting a corn-cob pipe on the way, and still
chuckling softly to himself.</p>

<p>Not long after this affair, the father of the two
Wetzel boys was returning from a hunting excursion
into the Ohio wilderness. With him were his sons
Martin and Lewis. The latter had just shot a brown
bear, and carried the skin with him in the bottom of
the canoe. As they were gliding down the river, a
band of Shawnees suddenly appeared upon the bank.</p>

<p>“Come ashore, palefaces!” said one. “It is not
good for you to go down the river!”</p>

<p>“Paddle to the other side of the stream,” whispered
the older Wetzel. “Hasten, boys, or their bullets
will reach us.”</p>

<p>Quickly they turned towards the opposite bank, but
a volley of lead pursued them. They kept on doggedly.
A missile struck the old pioneer, inflicting a
mortal wound.</p>

<p>“Lie down, Martin!” cried he. “They will get
you also, if you do not do so.”</p>

<p>Then the heroic old man paddled forward, his life-blood
ebbing at every stroke. Volley after volley<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
zipped around the frail barque. Again and again the
frontiersman was struck, so that when well beyond
range of the Indian rifles he fell fainting to the
bottom of the canoe. That evening he expired.</p>

<p>Standing over the body of their parent, both Wetzels
took a solemn oath to avenge his untimely end.</p>

<p>“From now on,” said Lewis,” I will use every
endeavor to slaughter the red men. They have killed
my dear father. Death shall be upon their own heads.
Death and no quarter.”</p>

<p>Not a week had elapsed after the sudden end of
this staunch man of the frontier, when news was
brought into Wheeling that the Indians were again
upon the war-path. A scout came running into the
settlement, crying:</p>

<p>“The Shawnees and Wyandots are approaching.
They have slaughtered one man, and are burning,
killing and scalping. Every able-bodied settler is
needed to drive them away.”</p>

<p>Immediately all turned out with rifle and powder-horn
in order to repel the invaders. But before they
started, a purse of one hundred dollars was made up,
to go to the first individual who should take an Indian
scalp. The trail of the marauders was soon struck;
was followed for several miles; and was found to be
very fresh. Then the advance scouts returned with
the information that a large body of the enemy was
encamped a few miles ahead.</p>

<p>“They are too many to be attacked,” said the soldiers
of the advance. “We must go back to Wheeling,
or they will surround and annihilate us.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>They set off upon the return, but they noticed, as
they did so, that Lewis Wetzel did not move.</p>

<p>“Are you not going to accompany us?” asked
some of the trappers.</p>

<p>The frontiersman scowled.</p>

<p>“I set out to hunt Indians and thought that this
had also been your purpose,” said he. “My object
in hunting Indians is to kill them, and now that we
have treed our game I do not intend to run off without
a shot. As for you, I consider you to be a band
of cowards.”</p>

<p>“It is too bad about you,” said they. “As for
ourselves, we intend to return home.”</p>

<p>Wetzel gazed after them with an amused smile,
then stooped and examined his arms, for he was a
man of caution.</p>

<p>“I will get a scalp of my own,” said he. “Perhaps
more. These fellows will see that I mean what I
say.”</p>

<p>There were plenty of Indian signs, but he could
find no large bands of the red men; instead, he
stumbled upon a camp with only two braves in
it.</p>

<p>“There must be more in the encampment,” thought
he. “I will creep away; will come back this evening;
and will then have an opportunity to get what
I am after.”</p>

<p>Turning again into the forest, he was soon out of
hearing, and, by great good fortune, came across a
red deer, which he killed. He had a fine feast. As
night fell he hastened towards the Indian camp, crept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
close to it, and found only one red man, instead of
a dozen or more, as he had expected. He waited until
the redskin was fast asleep and then made good his
boast. As he started upon the back trail for the settlement,
a fresh scalp hung at his girdle.</p>

<p>Owing to his great strength and agility, he reached
Wheeling just one day behind his companions, instead
of three. They were delighted to see him.</p>

<p>“My boy,” cried they, “you have certainly made
good and are entitled to the greatest possible credit.
Bully for you!”</p>

<p>The trapper in fact was more than a match for
many redskins, as the following will show:</p>

<p>Not long after his return to Wheeling he went out
into the forest in order to get some venison to dry
and salt for winter use. He saw no game, but suddenly
stumbled upon a camp of four Shawnees, who
were busily engaged in tanning some deer hides. They
did not see or hear him, so he determined to return
at nightfall and single-handed to attack the party of
braves. This he did.</p>

<p>First, resting his rifle against a tree so that it would
be close at hand for any emergency, he drew his tomahawk,
uttered a wild yell, and dashed in among the
savages, cutting down one of them in a moment. Two
more fell beneath his unerring weapon. The fourth
darted off into the woodland with Wetzel close upon
his heels. He was a good runner and got safely away,
while the man of the frontier returned for the scalp-locks
of the three. He was back at Wheeling before
two days were over.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>“What luck did you have, Lewis?” asked a companion.</p>

<p>“Not much,” answered the man-of-the-woods. “I
treed four of th’ pesky varmints. But one slick-ez-lightnin’
feller got away. He had er close call.”</p>

<p>At Marietta, Ohio, was a frontier fortification
where a number of troops were stationed to protect
the settlements from Shawnee invasion. Here General
Harmer summoned several tribes to meet him in
conference, and here Lewis Wetzel and a scout called
Dickerson ambushed themselves near the Indian encampment
with the intention of killing the first warrior
who might pass. Wetzel, you see, was a vindictive
fellow and did not even fight in the open.</p>

<p>The two assassins had not long to wait, for a redskin
soon came by on the gallop without show or
sign of fear, because a flag of truce had been delivered
to the whites but a short time before. As he passed,
both men fired, and, although the warrior reeled in
his saddle, he clung to the mane of his horse with a
tenacious grip and rode on into the fort. Here he
dropped exhausted to the ground, and, before dying,
cried out:</p>

<p>“My white brothers, I demand vengeance upon
these hidden men who have driven me to the Great
Spirit. You who have true hearts, see that I get
what I desire, and my soul will then rest in peace.”</p>

<p>When news of this was brought to General Harmer,
he said, with much heat:</p>

<p>“Justice shall be done to this poor redskin. I hear
from some of my men that Lewis Wetzel was responsible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
for this affair. Captain Kingsbury will therefore
take his company and scour the woods for the rascal.
Let him be brought to me, dead or alive.”</p>

<p>Wetzel, meanwhile, had returned to his home in the
Mingo Bottom settlement and was engaged in a
shooting match for a turkey. When the soldiers arrived,
and the frontiersmen learned what they were
after, they gathered around their comrade with the
remark that:</p>

<p>“Whoever touches Lewis Wetzel will have tew
fight th’ hull gang uv us.”</p>

<p>Captain Kingsbury therefore withdrew, but Lewis
Wetzel was not careful to keep beyond the clutch of
his arm. Some time afterwards he paddled down the
river to an island opposite Harmer’s Fort in order to
spend the night with a friend, and news of his presence
was brought to the soldiers within the stockade.
A company of men was soon headed for the island:
the frontiersman was surrounded at midnight; was
thrown into the guard-house, heavily ironed, and was
not only deprived of open air, but also of exercise.
He quickly sickened and grew pale. When told that
he would shortly be hung, he sent for General Harmer,
and said:</p>

<p>“General, I am not ashamed of my deed, for ever
since the day that my people were brutally slain by
the children of the forest, I have considered it perfectly
justifiable for me to do unto them what they
have done unto me. If you will grant me one request,
it is that you allow me to go loose among the savages
armed only with a tomahawk. Then I will have one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
chance in a thousand to escape, but I will take that
chance.”</p>

<p>The General shook his head.</p>

<p>“The scaffold is the proper death for you,” he replied.
“As an officer of the law I must see that you
receive the fit punishment for your crimes. But, as
I see that you are growing pale under strict confinement,
I hereby order that the irons be taken from
your legs. Your handcuffs must remain.”</p>

<p>The trapper bowed his head, but as soon as the
General had gone and he was allowed to move in the
open air, he frisked about like a young colt. A number
of soldiers guarded him closely, but as he walked
and jumped around in front of them, he continually
experimented with his handcuffs, in the endeavor to
wrest his arms from their grip. Gradually he edged
farther and farther from the guard. Finally he had
moved to a position from which he felt that he could
safely get away. With one mighty bound he had
turned and was off into the forest. Volley after
volley came from the soldiers, but he escaped untouched.</p>

<p>Wetzel knew well the woodland in which he found
himself, and hastening to a dense thicket pushed
through a close tangle of briars to a fallen tree. He
wedged himself beneath this, and none too soon, for
within a very few moments a number of Indians and
soldiers approached. Twice some redskins sat upon
the very tree beneath which he was crouching, and
he heard one say:</p>

<p>“Ah, but the white dog would make good running<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
through the ranks of our red brothers. We must stick
our knives into him when we find him.”</p>

<p>At last darkness came. The trapper heard his pursuers
returning, so he crept stealthily from his hiding-place
and made for the river. He reached it in an
hour, and by the light of the half moon, saw a frontiersman
fishing from a canoe. He was afraid to call
to him, for the woods were full of Indians, so he attracted
his attention by beating upon the water with
a stick. The fellow saw him; picked him up, and
paddled him to the other shore, where his handcuffs
were cut from his wrists. Next day he stood among
his own friends.</p>

<p>Not long after this remarkable escape the trapper
was at a fort on Wheeling Creek from which a number
of pioneers had mysteriously disappeared.</p>

<p>“They have been killed by the redskins,” said one
of the backwoodsmen, who resided there. “How,
where, and when, no one seems to know; but, my
friend, there have been mysterious calls of turkeys in
the woods. Turkeys, mark you, my friend,&mdash;wild
turkeys!”</p>

<p>Wetzel pricked up his ears. He remembered that
each of the men who had been killed had heard turkey
calls near the fort: had gone out to shoot one for
supper: and had never returned. The turkey calls
had all come from one direction and here was a high
hill covered with boulders. A small cave-like depression
could be seen from the camp. Putting two and
two together, he decided that Mr. Redskin had produced
the call of Mr. Turkey and that it was Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
Redskin’s unerring aim that had put an end to the
lives of so many good frontiersmen. “I shall soon
stop the twaddle of the fascinating tongue of Mr.
Gobbler,” said the scout to himself.</p>

<p>Setting out one morning, before day had broken,
he soon drew near a hill, on the top of which was a
small cave. It was an excellent spot in which to hide
one’s self, and, placing himself in ambush, he watched
it narrowly. At sunrise he saw the tufted head of a
Shawnee appear in the narrow opening, and the
“gobble, gobble, gobble” of a turkey, sounded from
the throat of the savage. The trapper bent low and
watched the performance, for it was an exact imitation
of the male bird. “Gobble, gobble, gobble,”
echoed again from the gloom of the cave, and,
“crack” sounded the rifle of the bold pioneer. A
wail of anguish arose from the cavern’s mouth. Then
all was still. The Shawnee gobbler had gone to the
Happy Hunting Grounds.</p>

<p>Well pleased with himself, Wetzel started back to
the fort with the scalp-lock of the enterprising brave,
and, as he neared the stockade, met a soldier hastening
towards him.</p>

<p>“Did you hear that turkey call?” said the enthusiastic
sportsman. “I’m going out to get him, sure.”</p>

<p>The scout pointed to his girdle.</p>

<p>“There is Mr. Gobbler,” said he. “He was the
kind of a bird that shoots a rifle. My boy, you should
thank your lucky stars that I saw him first.”</p>

<p>Not long after this event the frontiersman made a
journey to the Kanawha River with John Madison,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
brother of James Madison, at one time President of
the United States. They were busy surveying some
land, and one day came to a hunter’s cabin, which
appeared to be deserted.</p>

<p>“No one is here,” said Madison. “Let us take
some of this jerked venison and also a pailful of this
coffee. I do not believe that the camp will be again
visited, and we may as well have the food, as to let the
wood-mice eat it.”</p>

<p>“All right,” answered the trapper, and, without
more ado, they appropriated what they wished, and
continued upon their journey.</p>

<p>Early the next day, as they were crossing a small
valley, many shots rang out, and wild war-whoops
sounded from every side. Cries of “You give back
our venison!” were heard above the din, and Madison
reeled in his saddle, falling head-long to the ground.
Wetzel did not wait to see what had happened to him,
but, digging his heels into his horse’s flanks, dashed
off into the brush.</p>

<p>Now was a furious chase. Although well mounted,
the scout soon saw that the red men also had good
ponies, and he feared that they would catch him.
Over the mountain paths they flew, for hour after
hour. At last they neared a broad river, and leaping
his horse into it, the scout swam to the other side.
The red men had not the courage to follow where he
had led, and thus he made good his escape.</p>

<p>The pioneer had a generous heart in spite of his
vindictiveness to all savages, and not long afterwards
had an opportunity to display his good feeling towards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
the weak and distressed. Going with a friend one
day to pay a visit to a frontier house belonging to the
Bryans, they found indications that the Indians had
just been there, for the home was burned to the
ground. Tracks in the moist earth led into the forest,
and besides those of the redskins were the print of a
woman’s feet.</p>

<p>“Miss Betsy Bryan has been carried off, I fear,”
said Wetzel sorrowfully, pointing to the footprints.
“We must rescue her even if it costs us our lives.
Comrade, let us hasten to the chase.”</p>

<p>His companion nodded, and, without more ado, the
two men of the frontier followed the well-marked trail
of the savages. Towards evening they crossed the
Ohio River. Not far from the bank was a camp-fire,
and, going towards it with great caution, they saw
the girl seated near the flames. A white renegade
and three Indians were her companions.</p>

<p>“Lie down, comrade,” whispered Wetzel to his
friend. “I will tell you when to rouse yourself, for
we cannot attack until these redskins are asleep.”</p>

<p>His companion obeyed, and waking him about two
o’clock in the early morning, the scout told him to
fire at one of the red men and then to rush into the
camp in order to protect the captive. “I, myself, will
attend to the renegade,” said he.</p>

<p>Both frontiersmen fired at about the same time.
The renegade was done for, as was one Indian, also.
The two remaining savages took to their heels. Wetzel
was after them in a jiffy, but, as they soon hid in
the brush, he fired his rifle off, thinking that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
might pursue him if they believed that his weapon
were empty. He was not mistaken. The savages
rushed from their hiding-places, gave close chase, and
gained rapidly upon the running plainsman. They
began to yelp wildly, as they thought that they had
him cornered, but they did not know that this was the
famous trapper who could load while on the run.</p>

<p>Turning about, Wetzel now shot the nearest red
man, but the other kept on after him like a flash. The
scout loaded while darting forward, as usual, then
wheeling quickly, he dispatched this second assailant.
His wonderful ability to load when at full speed had
made it thus possible for him to thoroughly avenge
the assault upon the frontier settlement and the capture
of the inoffensive girl. Taking the scalp-locks
of the two fallen braves and tying them to his girdle,
he was soon back at the camp, where he was tearfully
greeted by the rescued maiden. In a short time they
were at home in the settlement.</p>

<p>Wetzel continued his life of hardship and adventure
after this; made a journey south, where he was imprisoned
at New Orleans, and, in 1803, joined Lewis
and Clark in their expedition up the Missouri River.
He left them after two months, and spent about two
years near the headwaters of the Yellowstone, engaged
in trapping and in hunting. From now on, until his
death in 1818, he was a trapper and fur trader; his
hatred for the redskins remaining unabated until his
demise. He was camping near Natchez, Mississippi,
when this occurred.</p>

<p>A braver man never lived than this famous scout,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
who could load while on the run, and who had probably
experienced more hairbreadth escapes than most
of the pioneers. His one great failing was his dislike
for the red men and desire to put them out of the
way, but, after one considers the distressing circumstances
attending the death of the members of his
family, when he was a mere youth, one can pardon
this bloodthirstiness. There was much good in Lewis
Wetzel; the valorous frontiersman of the early days
of the settlement of the United States.</p>

<div class="break">

<h2 class="p4">SAMUEL COLTER:</h2>

<p class="pch">AND HIS WONDERFUL RACE FOR LIFE</p>

<p class="drop-cap02">WHEN Lewis and Clark were on their way
to the Pacific coast they had with them two
trappers, one of whom was to meet with
extraordinary adventures. These were Samuel Colter
and Lemuel Potts&mdash;both sturdy sons of the West&mdash;who
obtained permission from the leaders of the expedition
to remain near the headwaters of the Missouri
River, in order to hunt and to trap. They intended
to overtake the main body, after a short time,
and hoped to obtain enough beaver skins to net them
a good sum of money upon their return to civilization.
You probably remember that Lewis had trouble with
the Blackfeet, when near the Missouri, one of whom
he had to kill because he began to run off the horses.
For this reason these two trappers knew that they
would have to use extreme caution or else they would
fall into the clutches of some of these savages. The
vengeance of an Indian is always swift and sure.</p>

<p>Knowing that the redskins were all about them, the
trappers decided upon the following plan: they would
lie hidden during the day, would set their traps late
in the evening, and would visit them in order to remove
the game in the gray of the early morning.
Success met their efforts, and, before long, they had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
a goodly quantity of skins. No Indians were seen,
although Indian sign was abundant, and they knew
that there were plenty of Blackfeet in the vicinity.</p>

<p>One morning, while paddling up a winding stream
where numerous traps were set, to their keen ears
came the sound of heavy tramping.</p>

<p>“Those are redskins,” whispered Colter. “Let’s
decamp at once, and get back to our starting-place.”</p>

<p>But Potts thought differently.</p>

<p>“Those are buffalo,” said he. “Wait until we
round the corner and you will find out that I am
right.”</p>

<p>Just then they swirled around the bend in the
stream, and to their dismay, found both banks fairly
swarming with Blackfeet. Escape was impossible,
and, although cold shivers began to run up and down
his spine, Colter ran the bow of the canoe towards
the bank.</p>

<p>The red men began to whoop loudly, as they saw
them approach, and called to them to come ashore.
This they did, and, as they stepped upon the bank, a
burly savage jumped forward and snatched the rifle
which Potts carried, from his hand. Colter was a
man of great physical strength and courage, who was
not afraid of twenty savages. He wrested the weapon
away from the redskin, handed it back to Potts, and
confronted the startled braves with a face filled with
determination and fire. Potts jumped into his canoe,
pushed out into the stream, and started to paddle
away, in spite of the commands of Colter, who cried
to him to come back and take him with him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>Suddenly an arrow whizzed from the bank and
Potts cried out, “I’m wounded, Colter. I cannot
come to your assistance.”</p>

<p>In spite of this, he raised his rifle, fired, and killed
the redskin who had shot him. A wild yelping now
arose from the other savages, and, before five minutes
had passed, the body of Potts fell into the water,
riddled with hundreds of arrows.</p>

<p>Colter stood upon the bank, unarmed and alone.
The Blackfeet swarmed around him; stripped him of
his clothes and then held a pow-wow, while they determined
what they should do with him.</p>

<p>“Let’s skin him alive!” said one.</p>

<p>“No, whip him to death!” suggested another.</p>

<p>“Burn him at the stake!” shouted a great many.</p>

<p>The wrangling thus continued, until it was decided
to let him run a race for his life. He was to get
away if he could, but, if he could not, he was to be
burned at the stake. All seemed to be much pleased
at this decision.</p>

<p>A chief now approached the captive and said:
“Paleface, you run fast, eh?”</p>

<p>“No, no, chief,” answered the trapper, “I am very
poor runner, I slow as the tortoise.”</p>

<p>This was an untruth, for Colter was one of the
swiftest foot racers upon the border, but his reply was
hailed with loud shouts. Led upon a sandy plain by
the chief, he was followed by six hundred armed
red men, who gave him a start of three hundred
yards, and then told him to go.</p>

<p>As Colter dashed away, a fierce whoop arose from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
all the red men and they started in pursuit with continued
yelping. In a few moments they saw that it
would take their swiftest runners to overhaul the
white man, for he sped along like a greyhound. They
had, however, a great advantage over him, for his feet
were naked, and there were prickly plants, sand bars,
and sharp stones upon the plain. Their feet, on the
other hand, were protected by stout deer-skin moccasins.</p>

<p>On, on, sped the gallant scout, although his feet
were cruelly lacerated by the stones and shrubs. On,
on, he went, while the shouting of the red men died
away, as they perceived that he was out-distancing
them. None caught up to him, in fact, he drew rapidly
away from the very swiftest of them all.</p>

<p>After a run of three miles Colter glanced back
over his shoulder and saw that one of his pursuers
was holding his own with him. He had headed
towards the Jefferson Fork of the Missouri River,
and knew that if he once reached the water he could
doubtless hide himself. The pursuing red man had
a spear in his hand, and, so fleet was he, that he was
soon within a hundred yards of the trapper.</p>

<p>“If I do not stop this Indian,” said Colter to himself,
“it is all over with me.”</p>

<p>Straining every muscle in order to get away, Colter
suddenly felt the blood gushing from his nose, and
knew that a slight hemorrhage had been occasioned
by his efforts. He was but a mile from the river, and,
again looking back, saw the Indian within twenty
yards of him. Escape was now impossible. Turning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
swiftly around,&mdash;he stood absolutely still and opened
his arms.</p>

<p>The red man was astounded at this unexpected
action, and, in endeavoring to check his headway, fell
to the ground. The lance, meanwhile, flew from his
hand and stuck into the earth a considerable distance
from him, where it broke off. Luck was with the half-winded
man of the plains, who now turned about,
seized the broken spear-head, and darted swiftly to
the side of the prostrate red man.</p>

<p>The trapper aimed the sharp lance at the Indian,
and drove it into him with such force that he was
pinned to the earth. A deep groan came from the
helpless brave, as the backwoodsman again turned to
run towards the river, although he was now exhausted
by loss of blood and by the terrible race for life. His
pursuers were still far behind, and he reached Jefferson’s
Fork so far ahead of them that they could not
see him. One spring&mdash;he had leaped into the water&mdash;and
was swimming towards a little island about a
hundred yards from the bank.</p>

<p>Upon the edge of this had lodged a clump of sticks
and floating brush. Colter made for it and dove beneath
the tangled mass; emerging somewhere in its
centre, with his head between two giant logs. Breathing
with great difficulty, and faint from his exhausting
run, he waited with throbbing heart for the red
men to arrive. This they did very shortly.</p>

<p>They had stopped beside the body of their comrade
and found that he was in his death-agony. Infuriated
by this, and with terrific yells, they again set out in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
pursuit of Colter, who heard their vindictive screeching
as they reached the bank. Some of them swam
out to the island and punched about in the drift with
their spears. As they did so, the trapper drew down
in the water so that only his nose was exposed. He
remained thus for about half an hour, when the redskins
gave up their search and returned to the body
of the fallen chieftain. Colter feared that they might
set fire to the drift, but this idea did not seem to have
entered the minds of the Blackfeet, who began a
hideous wailing as they gathered around their leader.
Carrying him upon their shoulders, they started back
to their camp, and gradually their wild lamentations
died away in the shadows of the forest.</p>

<p>The trapper was in a desperate predicament, for he
was without either clothes or rifle. His feet had been
lacerated by the stones and plants so that he could
walk only with difficulty, and his body was chilled
by his long immersion in the cold waters of the
river. Certainly there was no brilliant prospect before
him, for he was miles from any settlement. Would
you not think that he would have become absolutely
disheartened and would have given up in
despair?</p>

<p>Not so with this bold follower of Lewis and Clark.
After a day’s rest and a meal of berries, grass and
stalks from a shrub known as the sheep sorrel, he
started for Lisa’s Fort on the Yellowstone, a distance
of a week’s hard journey. Fortune favored this man
of iron. Toads, frogs, and insects became his food,
and with clothing of bark and reeds he finally reached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
the hospitable shelter of Manuel Lisa’s trading station.
He was scarcely recognizable.</p>

<p>Colter had suffered untold agony from thirst, from
hunger and from cold. The evenings are chilly in
this country&mdash;even in summer&mdash;and, although he
made a fire by rubbing two dry sticks together, he
shivered all through the night. The wild sheep sorrel
had given him most needed nourishment, while the
body of a dead rabbit, which he fortunately stumbled
upon, had brought sufficient strength to carry him to
the Fort. No wonder that the trappers there gave
three rousing cheers for this frontier hero.</p>

<p>In ten days after his arrival at the group of log
huts, Samuel Colter was again fit for service, but
Lewis and Clark were already far away upon their
transcontinental journey. He remained at the Fort,
had several brushes with the Blackfeet, and eventually
found his way back to the settlements, where he
was much admired for his nerve and courage in
eluding the wild denizens of the plains near the headwaters
of the Missouri. Certainly he had good reason
to be proud of his escape from the bloodthirsty hands
of the Blackfoot warriors. Three cheers for brave
Sam Colter! He well deserves to be remembered as
a Marathon runner who ran a more thrilling race than
the tame affairs of the present day, where no band
of savages, who are thirsting for one’s gore, pursue
the struggling athletes.</p>

<h2 class="p4">MESHACK BROWNING:</h2>

<p class="pch">THE CELEBRATED BEAR HUNTER OF
THE ALLEGHANIES</p>

<p class="drop-cap03">IN 1781 was born in Frederick County, Maryland,
a pioneer who was truly entitled to the name of
“The Mighty Hunter.” The son of one of General
Braddock’s soldiers, who had settled in this beautiful
country, Meshack Browning lived his life in the
wild fastnesses of the then uncleared mountains of
the Blue Ridge, and, at the close of a long and eventful
career as a huntsman and trapper, could say with
pride that he had killed from eighteen hundred to
two thousand deer; from three to four hundred
beaver; about fifty panthers; and scores of wolves
and wildcats. He was the hero of every man’s conversation
in this mountain republic. All looked up to
the hardy pioneer, and, after his long and eventful
life was brought to a close, when well beyond eighty
years of age, no one was more cordially missed than
this sturdy old man of the mountains.</p>

<p>Young Meshack’s father died when he was an infant
of but two weeks of age, leaving his mother
desperately poor, with one daughter named Dorcas,
and three sons. It was a hard struggle to bring them
up, but by working in the garden, by raising plenty of
vegetables, and by spinning, saving and knitting, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
good lady managed to scrape along somehow or other.
Little Meshack had to learn how to use the rifle at
an early age, for by this means only was it possible
to supply the larder with fresh meat. Wild turkeys
were abundant; deer, wildcats, wolves and bear
roamed all through the rugged hills round about their
home. Thus he quickly became expert in the use of
the flint-lock.</p>

<p>The hunting season usually began in October, and
during this month the task was commenced of laying
in the winter’s provisions. Some days little Meshack
would go out with a kindly uncle who had joined
the family and would hunt for deer. On other days
he would chase after bees, and as he and his uncle
were most successful in this kind of hunting, they
would often spend more time in searching for honey
than in seeking venison. It would not be long before
the table would be well supplied with both deer steaks
and honey. The high, fresh grass which surrounded
the log cabin would cause their cows to give a quantity
of milk, from which little Meshack’s aunt, who
was an industrious woman, made plenty of butter;
and frequently a fat turkey would be added to the
store. Thus life was simple, easy, and healthful in
the wild fastnesses of the Blue Ridge.</p>

<p>Things went on well enough until word came to
the pioneers that General St. Clair’s army had been
defeated and cut to pieces by the redskins under Little
Turtle, which you no doubt remember. This was
frightful news, and little Meshack’s mother was very
much afraid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>“What if the Indians fall upon us here,” said she.
“We could not protect ourselves against these terrible
red men. Let us move further back into the
country where there are more white people. We can
thus combine for our own defense.”</p>

<p>Meshack’s uncle thought about the same way, so,
packing up their few belongings, the little family hurried
to a place called the “Blooming Rose,” where
there were thirty or forty other families. This was
in 1792&mdash;long, long ago, it seems&mdash;and yet I, myself,
have known old fellows of these mountains who
appeared to be well conversant with the terrible battles
of St. Clair, “Mad Anthony” Wayne, and the redskins
under Little Turtle. These many struggles had
been often narrated to them by their parents; most of
whom had taken part in those stirring events.</p>

<p>Not long after coming to this settlement, the youthful
Meshack had his first adventure with a bear.
While milking a cow one day, he heard a great deal
of noise at the house, and inquiring what it all meant,
was told by one of the girls who lived there that a
bear had just gone by. Running to the front portico
he there found that four or five gentlemen, who had
come to visit the owner of the house (bringing with
them their bird-guns, and several little dogs), had
gone in pursuit of the beast. The dogs were so small
that two of them would have made about a mouthful
for Brother Bruin.</p>

<p>The owner of the house, Mr. Caldwell, was a successful
bear hunter and had two fine dogs which were
well trained to fight these animals. Meshack called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
them, took the old man’s gun, and ran in the direction
of the noise, until he overtook the party of huntsmen,
who had halted just as the bear reached a clump of
woods. The little dogs would not leave their master,
for they seemed to be afraid that the bear would tear
them to pieces. But as soon as Mr. Caldwell’s animals
scented the bear, off they went, heads down and tails
up. Meshack followed on behind.</p>

<p>On, on, coursed the dogs: on, on, went Meshack.
Hastening towards the sounds of the fray, the young
hunter saw both bear and dogs turning somersaults
down a very steep hill. Over and over they rolled,
Meshack after them as hard as he could tilt, and the
way that the fur flew was most interesting. The fight
became desperate, and the bear found that his hindquarters
were suffering severely; so severely, in fact,
that he determined to climb a large tree. When halfway
up to the lowest branches, he saw Meshack come
puffing and blowing down the hill. This frightened
him and he attempted to descend to the ground.</p>

<p>As he crawled slowly towards the sod, Meshack let
drive and sent a small rifle ball through the middle of
his body. The bear plunged to the earth, making two
or three somersaults as he did so, but finding the dogs
too ferocious for him, he immediately ascended a large
oak tree. The oak being forked and very high, he
went up to the first branch, and, lying down on it,
refused to move. By this time the gentlemen who
owned the little dogs had come up, and as many of
them had never seen a bear before, they began to consult
among themselves about what was to be done.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
Meshack had no more balls for his little rifle and they
had nothing but small shot.</p>

<p>After a lengthy discussion it was agreed to try and
see what a load of shot would do for Mr. Bruin.
Meshack agreed that it was impossible to kill the bear
with that and told the other huntsmen to let the beast
alone until he fetched some more balls, or else secured
some one else to come and shoot him.</p>

<p>“Stand back and keep your counsel to yourself,”
cried one of the men. “We know how to handle this
rascally bear. Let us finish him off!”</p>

<p>Taking aim at the animal’s head, one of them again
fired, but this only made the bear snort, scratch his
face, and climb up the tree as far as he could go.
Here he seated himself upon another fork, and, although
repeatedly shot at, would not budge.</p>

<p>The bear hunters were feeling very much discouraged.
After a long parley they decided to send for
a certain pioneer called John Martin, who could shoot
a squirrel off the highest tree in the woods. A scout
was dispatched for him, and, at about nine in the
evening, he returned with the famous marksman, who
brought a rifle shooting an ounce ball. After the
trapper had had full time to recover his breath, which
climbing the high hill had rendered rather short, he
placed himself in a good position and let drive. Mr.
Bear remained in his place unscathed. Several more
shots were fired by the old fellow, but Bruin simply
hugged the limb in apparent comfort.</p>

<p>“Here, boys,” cried one, “is a Mr. Morris&mdash;a
Revolutionary officer&mdash;who has killed many an English<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
soldier. Let him have a crack at this elusive
mark!”</p>

<p>“Yes! Yes!” called several. “Give some one
else a chance.”</p>

<p>The new marksman cleaned and loaded his gun,
took careful aim, and off went the musket. The bear
snorted, groaned, and made a great fuss, but remained
in its place. Another load was prepared and the Captain
again tried his luck, when the bear, apparently
provoked by such ill treatment, rose from his resting-place
and started for the group. But upon arriving at
the lowest fork of the tree, and seeing so many men
and dogs, his courage failed him, and he again lay
down. Mr. Martin tried two or three more shots
without any result. Bruin seemed to be made of
cast iron.</p>

<p>“Let me have a shot at him,” said Meshack, at
this juncture. “I believe that I can kill the old boy.”</p>

<p>“Stand out of the way!” cried the Revolutionary
soldier. “I am sure that I can finish him off, and
I’ll knock you out if you interfere with me.”</p>

<p>It was getting dark by now, and Bruin was still
unkilled. It soon was so dark that Mr. Martin could
not see the powder in the pan. The gun missed fire.</p>

<p>“Here, Mr. Martin,” cried young Browning.
“Give me your gun, and I will finish this confounded
rascal.”</p>

<p>The old frontiersman passed him the piece.</p>

<p>“Take it,” said he, “and good riddance.”</p>

<p>Meshack felt for the powder in the pan and found
it empty, but having some in a horn, he placed it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
carefully in the proper vent and was ready to try
his luck. There were fourteen men now around the
tree.</p>

<p>The young pioneer could only see the bear by getting
him between himself and the sky, but he took
the best aim that he could, and fired. Pow! Down
came the bear this time with a thud; and, with a
wild yelping and barking, the dogs made for him. A
shout of horror arose from the bystanders as they all
took to the trees, while over and over, down the steep
hill, rolled the bear and the dogs, until they fell into
a hole, where they stopped. A terrible snarling, yelping
and growling now ensued.</p>

<p>The last shot had so disabled the bear that he lay
upon his back defending himself valiantly as the dogs
made for him. Meshack had now nothing to shoot
him with, so he went in search of a club, and pulling a
dry pole out by the roots, broke it off short, and went
into the fray.</p>

<p>Creeping behind the bear, as he was reaching after
the dogs in front, he struck him on the head between
the ears, while down he went, the dogs attacking his
hindquarters, meanwhile, and holding on to him
tightly. The tough, old fellow uttered one despairing
growl, then rolled over, stone dead. His end had
come.</p>

<p>Meshack kept absolutely still, and, as he crouched
near the bear, the back-track party began to come up.
All had descended from their trees when they saw
the bear rolling down the hill.</p>

<p>“Where is Browning?” asked one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>“Goodness only knows,” answered another.</p>

<p>“I expect that the young fool has run on the bear
and has been killed by him.”</p>

<p>“Hello, Browning! Hello!” cried many.</p>

<p>Young Meshack would not answer.</p>

<p>“It’s no use to call,” said one of the tree climbers.
“He’s as dead as a door nail.”</p>

<p>Still Meshack would not answer, because he wanted
to hear what they would all say.</p>

<p>“Hello! Browning!” was repeated.</p>

<p>“What do you want?” at length cried the young
pioneer.</p>

<p>“Where is the bear?”</p>

<p>“Here he is.”</p>

<p>“What is he doing?”</p>

<p>“He is dead.”</p>

<p>“Well, I reckon that isn’t true, because you couldn’t
kill him without a gun or a tomahawk, and you haven’t
got either of them.”</p>

<p>“I beat him to death with a club.”</p>

<p>“By George! you are fool enough to do anything.
We don’t believe you.”</p>

<p>So saying, they gingerly began to come nearer and
nearer, until they were at the edge of the hole where
the bear lay dead. They would come no closer until
young Meshack took the bear by the foot and shook
it in the air.</p>

<p>“By Jingo! he is dead!” said one. “Bully for
you, my boy.”</p>

<p>The young pioneer now held up the club with which
he had dispatched the bear, and each took it and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
struck the dead beast on the head in order to say
that he had helped to kill the long-lived animal, but
no one congratulated Meshack. In fact, several let
it be known that they themselves had killed the tough,
old fellow.</p>

<p>The question now arose as to how Bruin was to be
carried home. Some were for getting two oxen and
a cart, but young Browning suggested that they carry
him on a pole. This they did, and staggering and
tumbling onward, the animal was gradually towed
towards the house of Mr. Caldwell. The bear was
laid in the kitchen, where the owner of the house came
to view him and to taunt the back-trackers and the
climbers for their cowardice. When closely examined,
it was seen that Captain Morris’s two shots had struck
him, one passing through his ear, the other breaking
two of his tusks, without doing any serious injury.
No ball from Martin’s numerous fusillades had
touched him at all.</p>

<p>“Your shot killed the bear, Browning,” said he,
turning to Meshack. “If the bear’s backbone had
not been weakened by the last shot he would have
undoubtedly killed many, if not all of them. As for
these fellows who climbed the trees, it was a most
cowardly trick, and the same thing would have
occurred had they been in a fight with the redskins.”</p>

<p>This was very galling to the back-trackers, and they
envied and abused young Meshack whenever they had
an opportunity. When the bear was cut up they even
did not wish to give Meshack a share of it, but Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
Caldwell insisted that he should have his just proportion
of the game.</p>

<p>“I have no use for the meat, sir,” said the youthful
pioneer. “But if you will give me the skin, I shall be
glad to have it.”</p>

<p>Mr. Caldwell immediately took up the hide and
presented it to him.</p>

<p>“It is justly yours,” said he, “for my dogs treed
him, and you killed him. You have a right to the
skin, because it has always been a rule among hunters
that the first blood drawn takes the skin, be it bear
or deer.”</p>

<p>Thus ended the young trapper’s first bear fight.
It raised his reputation as a fearless boy, and made
him admired and respected by all the stout backwoodsmen
of the Blue Ridge. Frequently, thereafter, when
he would be seated in the kitchen with the other children,
they would induce him to tell the whole tale and
would ridicule the back-track huntsmen for their cowardly
conduct. One of them, Miss Nancy Lee, said
to him one evening:</p>

<p>“Browning, I always thought that you were a
great coward, but I do not think so now. And I
heard father tell a strange man the other day that if
he had you in an Indian fight he knew that you would
attack the redskins as fearlessly as you did that bear.
Meshack, I have often wished that I had been born
a boy, then I would be some day a man and would
be able to kill or drive away the red rascals who followed
General St. Clair, so that they would never
again come back to murder the whites. If you had
seen as much of their work as I have, you would feel
as vindictively towards them as I, myself, do. Let
me tell you a story about them:</p>

     <div class="caption"><p class="pc450">“THERE WAS EVER THE DANGER OF AN ONRUSH BY THE REDSKINS.”</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>“Some years ago, before General St. Clair lost so
many men in a great fight with the Indians, father and
mother were compelled to leave this place, and we
all went up to the Fort at Wheeling, West Virginia.
The neighbors were forced to vacate their farms, also,
and go into the stockade. My father and three or
four of his friends used to go out to hunt for game
sometimes, and a few pioneers always stood guard
while they were away. Others worked at planting
and harvesting corn and at chopping wood. There
was ever the danger of an onrush by the redskins.</p>

<p>“At length news came to us that the Indians were
in the neighborhood. The Fort was put in the best
possible condition for defense, and we awaited their
approach. But no attack came. Several days passed
by, no sound came from the depths of the forest and
it was supposed that the savages had given up the
assault. But such was not the case.</p>

<p>“One day two Indians made their appearance on
the high hill above the town, across the river, and
opposite the Fort. They fired their rifles at the stockade
and then went slowly away, slapping their hands
behind them in token of derision and contempt for
the frontiersmen within the log enclosure.</p>

<p>“Many of the pioneers were outraged by such an
insult, for they were hot-tempered fellows. Several
began to run after the savages, and they would have
all gone had not the commanding officer stood in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
the gateway and stopped them. Twenty-four of the
boldest and most dashing ran up the steep hill after
the Indians, who kept on retreating as if with no
intention to offer battle. When the whites reached
the summit, they suddenly found themselves surrounded.
Crack! Crack! sounded many a rifle, and
bullets began to whizz by on every side. They gazed
about them in dismay. Fully four hundred painted
redskins were on three sides of them. Their only
hope was to turn and make a break for the Fort.</p>

<p>“The redskins, meanwhile, had moved to their rear,
and, as the frontiersmen approached, put up a stern
resistance to their assault. Many fell. Some escaped
unhurt and dashed madly for their haven of refuge,
pursued by the red men with wild, vindictive yelping.
My father was one of the last to get through the
lines, and, as he ran for his life, with a close friend of
his before him, he saw his companion fall to the
ground. As he passed him, the wounded man cried
out, ‘John, don’t leave me to be scalped,’ but my
father ran on, as he knew that he could do nothing
for him. A moment more and he saw a white renegade,
who had gone to live with the Indians some
years before. The fellow was close to him and carried
a spear, mounted on a handle like that of a pitchfork.
He was at my father’s heels when they arrived
at a narrow defile in the hill next to the Fort.
A large tree was lying on the ground and another small
one was standing very near it. Something tripped up
my father’s feet, and in he fell, between the two trees.
As he went down, the white renegade made a furious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
lunge at him. The spear, however, glanced off the
log, turned its point upward, and stuck so fast in the
standing tree that the white savage could not withdraw
it before my father leaped to his feet, escaped
unhurt, and reached the Fort in safety.</p>

<p>“The poor fellow who had called out to him for
help had had his thigh broken; but he crawled upon
his hands and knees to a hollow log, in which he hid
himself until dark, and then wriggled to the Fort. A
short time later a frontiersman came in with his arm
broken, but the rest all fell before the rifles, arrows
and tomahawks of the redskins.</p>

<p>“Thus perished twenty-one of the best and bravest
men in West Virginia. Their death was a great loss
to the frontier settlements, as also to the strength of
the Fort, which, in a few days, was hotly besieged by
these same red men. Their success had made them
bold. Having intercepted a boat loaded with cannonballs,
destined for the use of the garrison, the savages
procured a hollow tree, bound it round with as many
chains as they could, drove wedges underneath the
chains in order to tighten them as much as possible;
loaded it like a cannon, and, at a favorable moment,
let go a most tremendous broadside. Whang! The
whole thing exploded with a resounding boom, killing
several, wounding others, and frightening the rest
half out of their wits.</p>

<p>“They did not remain frightened, however, and
soon renewed their attack upon the Fort. Near by
was a log house belonging to Colonel Lane and the
assault was mainly directed against this place, but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
redskins were driven off. The powder became very
scarce in the house, so it was proposed that some men
should run to the log barricade for a supply. Among
the volunteers for this dangerous task was a sister of
Colonel Lane, who said that she, herself, would go.
It was objected to, and the young men insisted on
going themselves. But she was firm in her purpose
and replied that the loss of a woman would be felt
less than the loss of a man. Pinning up her dress, so
that her feet would have fair play, she started upon
her dangerous mission.</p>

<p>“The Indians were perfectly astonished at this
sight and did not fire a single shot at her. Thus she
reached the Fort in safety, secured plenty of powder,
which she tied to a belt around her waist, and off
she bounded again for the house. The red men were
not so lenient this time. Suspecting some mischief,
they fired a volley of balls after her, all of which
missed the fleeing woman, so that she reached the
house in safety, with plenty of powder with which
to withstand the future attacks of the savages.</p>

<p>“The Indians were now discouraged. Capturing
a fat cow, they roasted her hind quarters, had a feast,
and kept up a fusillade on the stockade while they
ate the tender meat. When the repast was over, they
all marched away in profound silence. As they disappeared,
a settler at one of the port-holes drew a bead
upon the last savage, but a random shot from somewhere
in the forest dropped him like a stone. A
wild war-whoop echoed from the sombre woodland
and the Indians had vanished.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus ended the story of the attack. It was a thrilling
tale, and Nancy concluded with the remark:</p>

<p>“I think, Browning, that if the Indians were to
commence hostilities again, while you were living
with us, you would fight for our family, wouldn’t
you?”</p>

<p>“Indeed,” replied the young bear hunter, “no Indian
would ever put hands upon you while life and
strength was left in my body sufficient to save you
from their accursed hands.”</p>

<p>And he meant what he said.</p>

<p>Not long afterwards the young frontiersman was
married, and desiring some bear meat for the winter
supply, started into the forest in order to secure a
quantity of this article. He knew where there was
a swamp of black haws (trees of which bears are very
fond) and so he walked rapidly for the bottom where
these grew. When in sight of the place, he went
around it in order to let his dogs have wind of the
thicket. He had two excellent hounds with him, the
older of which was sent into the swamp in order to
raise the game. In he went, and he was scarcely out
of sight before a loud snapping, howling, and yelping
came to the ears of the eager huntsman.</p>

<p>The young dog was crouching at the heels of the
trapper, but now he dashed into the thicket, also.
Soon there was hard fighting going on. Meshack,
himself, ran as fast as he could in the direction of the
battle. When he came up with the dogs, the bear had
taken to a tree, just out of their reach. He was a
big, brown fellow; very sleek and shiny. As he heard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
the trapper rushing through the bushes he let go his
hold, dropped to the ground, and was in an immediate
battle with the dogs. Browning ran the muzzle of
his gun against him and fired, but the bullet struck
too far back to seriously injure Brother Bruin. As
the musket went off, the dogs closed in and the fight
became most desperate. The bear was giving them
more than they could stand.</p>

<p>Meshack had dropped the gun in the weeds, and
had no means of protecting his pets except by means
of a large knife in his belt. It was now or never,
for the bear had one of them on the ground and was
biting him severely. In a few moments it would be
all over with him. Therefore the trapper ran up to
Brother Bruin and made a lunge at his side. The
knife struck him far back, and did not cause a mortal
wound. Still on he fought, though the blow released
the dog, who arose and attacked the bear again with
renewed energy, just as the beast attempted to crawl
beneath a log which was raised from the ground.
The young dog caught him by the nose as he went
under, while the other seized him by his right hind
leg. Both held fast, while Meshack ran upon him
with his knife and dealt him two or three severe blows.
Growling, snuffing, and breathing hard, the tough old
Bruin rolled over dead.</p>

<p>This was one of many such adventures. There
were also encounters with wildcats, panthers, wolves,
and other denizens of the woods. With deer, also,
there were many strange happenings, as the following
will prove:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>In February, 1800, the trapper and another young
man, called Louis Van Sickle, went into the woods in
order to catch a young deer, which Browning intended
to raise as a pet. The Virginia red deer will
become tame in two or three days, and even the oldest
bucks will prove quite docile after a few weeks’ confinement.
Several had been so tamed by the trapper
that they would come to him, put their nose in his
pocket, would take apples or moss out of it; would
eat this food, and would then search in his pockets
for more.</p>

<p>The snow was about four feet deep as the two trappers
went into the laurel swamps where the deer took
winter refuge. As they drew near the edge of the
swamp, they discovered many paths made by the animals
as they came out of the thicket in order to browse
upon the small bushes and on the moss upon the fallen
timber. They struck off, down one of the paths, and
soon saw seven large deer running and jumping up
and down in the deep snow. They pursued as best
they could, for they had snow-shoes on underneath
their moccasins, and soon Meshack was far ahead of
Van Sickle, who was unable to travel over the snow
with any speed.</p>

<p>When the trapper reached the hindmost deer, the
foremost ones, being tired out, had stopped to take
breath. The last one attempted to pass by those in
front and leaped into the deep snow, where he stuck
fast. Meshack caught hold of him with the intention
of tying him, but he was too fat and strong and fought
viciously. They were struggling together, when Louis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
came up with a long clasp-knife and cut the throat of
the buck. With the knife in his pocket, Meshack now
ran after the others, and soon overtook them as they
were crossing a small branch, with steep banks upon
either side. A large tree, which had fallen over the
stream, lay a short distance from the ground, where
many leaves had drifted under it. One of the bucks,
being hard pushed and greatly frightened, darted
among the leaves, and thus escaped the eyes of the
trapper, who had his attention upon the deer in front.
Meshack passed by, pursued the others for some distance,
caught a large buck, which he attempted to tie,
but he fought him desperately, and was so strong that
he could not handle him.</p>

<p>While engaged with this buck he heard Louis crying
out from behind:</p>

<p>“Hello! Browning! Come to my assistance!
Come quickly!”</p>

<p>Meshack left the buck and ran to the relief of his
friend, thinking, as he did so, that he had probably
fallen among the stones and had broken his leg, for
the ground was rocky and full of holes. As he ran
towards him, he said to himself: “If he has broken
a leg, I will first take my ropes and will tie him to a
tree, then I will pull it out straight, set the bone, and
will tear up some clothes and wrap them around the
limb, scrape a place clear of snow, build a good fire,
and leave him here while I go for a horse and sled
on which to carry him home.”</p>

<p>He was to be agreeably disappointed. As he came
in sight of his friend, he observed him lying upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
his back with his knees drawn up towards his face,
and his large, wide snow-shoes turned up to the sun.
Before him stood one of the largest bucks, with his tail
spread, his hair bristled up, and his eyes glowing fire.
He was carefully watching the prostrate trapper, and
every time that he moved the buck would spring upon
him and would beat him over the head and face with
his feet until he became quiet again. The irate deer
would wait until Louis would make another move,
then he would again jump upon him.</p>

<p>This was the same buck that had hidden underneath
the log when Meshack had passed by. The animal had
recovered his breath, and, as Van Sickle approached,
sprang upon him suddenly. Striking the astonished
trapper with his fore feet, he threw him backwards in
the deep snow, and every time that the scout would
attempt to arise, the deer would attack and strike at
him until he would lie still.</p>

<p>How often the buck had repeated this chastisement
before Meshack came in sight is difficult to say. When
the trapper saw his companion lying motionless, and
hallooing vociferously for help, he could not suppress
a loud laugh. Van Sickle made several attempts
to rise, but in vain; for the buck gave him a sound
beating at every move. The prostrate woodsman
was furious with rage. He cried out loudly:</p>

<p>“You intend to let me freeze here in the snow,
Browning? That is death, anyway, and I am going
to get out of this fix, or else lose my life in the attempt.
Can’t you drive this cursed buck away?”</p>

<p>As he ceased speaking, he made another move, and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
as the buck sprang upon him again with his fore feet,
he reached up, passed one arm around the animal’s
neck, and then the other. Drawing the deer close to
him, he vigorously endeavored to upset his valiant
opponent. Meshack continued his laughter, for it was
certainly a novel wrestling match, and the buck
seemed to have the trapper at his mercy. He determined
to let his friend fight it out to the bitter end,
without any assistance on his part.</p>

<p>The buck seemed to be weakening after fifteen
minutes of struggling, and Louis now raised his legs
and threw them over the animal’s back. The snow-shoes
were somewhat in the way, but he withdrew his
right hand from the deer’s neck, and, as he lay beneath
him, began to strike him in the ribs with his
closed fist.</p>

<p>“It’s now your turn, you rascal,” he called out.
“You have had your innings, and it is now my opportunity.
How do you like this&mdash;and this&mdash;and
this?”</p>

<p>Every time that he punched the buck the deer would
grunt and endeavor to strike him with his fore feet.</p>

<p>Meshack had stopped laughing by now, and walking
up to the fighting trapper, said:</p>

<p>“Let go of the buck, Louis, and I will finish him
with my hunting-knife.”</p>

<p>“No! No!” replied the woodsman. “I have a
good hold on him now, and I refuse to let go until
either he or I lose our lives.”</p>

<p>He continued to strike heavy blows upon the buck’s
side, as Meshack seized the animal by the ear. Now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
determined to end the affair, he quickly dispatched
him with his hunting-knife, and, as he dropped to the
snow, the prostrate trapper drew himself to his feet
with a loud shout of satisfaction and delight.</p>

<p>“Meshack,” said he, “you have saved my life! If
you had not come, I do not believe that I would have
whipped this fellow, for he was the toughest customer
that I ever tackled in my entire woodland experience.”</p>

<p>Van Sickle was so upset by the beating which the
buck had given him that he would never hunt any
more unless Browning went in advance, and if a bush
rattled, would jump back in deadly fear that another
buck was coming after him. He was severely injured,
having many black and blue lumps upon his head, and
one very black eye. Two or three days later, he exhibited
a long war-club, which he had made to defend
himself with, as well as to attack the fighting bucks.
It was eight feet in length, with a large knot upon
the upper end, and was a deadly means of defense.
He would never venture to the woods again unless
Meshack went along, and, as the trapper would not
go with him, he had no opportunity of trying his
murderous instrument.</p>

<p>Shortly after this strange and novel battle in the
woods, Meshack was asked by his wife to bring home
some young turkeys for supper. Telling her that he
could soon do this, he called his dog, Watch, and was
off into the woodland. His faithful hound had been
lame for more than a month from the bite of the last
bear which he had tackled, and was still very stiff.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
He frisked about his master in spite of this, and
seemed to be all ready for anything that might turn
up.</p>

<p>It was not long before the trapper saw three or
four old turkeys with perhaps thirty or forty young
ones. He sent Watch after them, in order to drive
them towards him, but they flew into some low, white
oak trees. When Meshack walked fast, as if he were
going past them, they would sit still as they could for
him to pass on. After taking twelve or fifteen steps
the trapper would shoot off their heads. He thus
kept on, until he had shot off the tops of nine young
turkeys. This was sufficient for the larder, and whistling
to his dog, he turned about for home.</p>

<p>Watch, however, seemed to be very much excited,
and kept whining and sniffing, as if some species of
game were near.</p>

<p>“What is it, my boy?” asked his master.</p>

<p>For answer the dog bounded away towards a large
mass of rocks. Here he began to bark vociferously,
so that the trapper felt sure that a bear was concealed
near by.</p>

<p>“Fetch him out, boy! Fetch him out!” he cried.</p>

<p>Down went the dog, and into a crevice in the rocks,
while Meshack raced to the other side. To his astonishment
no bear came forth, but a huge panther
bounded into the open, and, jumping from rock to
rock, was soon out of sight. The dog followed along
the rocks as best he could, and both quarry and pursuer
were soon lost to view. After a few moments,
however, the dog opened again, and seemed to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
coming back on the other side of the stones and laurel
bushes, which here grew in profusion.</p>

<p>Meshack turned to follow the dog. When he had
gone a few steps he heard something moving, and
wheeling about, saw the panther creeping close upon
him. As he went behind some rocks Meshack levelled
his rifle. When he came out the trapper fired, directing
the ball, as near as he could, to the heart of the
ferocious beast. The gun cracked. The panther
sprang into the air, snapping at the place where the
ball struck him. Then, turning towards the trapper,
he came on, put his paws on a small, fallen tree, and
looked his adversary full in the face.</p>

<p>Meshack drew his hunting-knife, and, as the panther
made a lunge at him, struck at him again and
again. The sharp claws ripped the hunting-shirt of
the bold pioneer and gashed his arms, but the fierce
thrusts of the hardened woodsman soon made the
beast cease his attack. He crawled into a leaning tree,
where he sat for a moment glaring at the man in
buckskin, and then came to the ground. In spite of
the fact that he was bleeding profusely, he soon disappeared
into a rocky cavern.</p>

<p>The bold trapper has written:</p>

<p>“I was really glad of it, for I found myself so
nervous that I could scarcely load my rifle, and, when
the panther was looking at me, I was determined that
if he made an attempt to come near me, I would seek
safety in flight. He would have been obliged to
ascend a steep hill, and, as I had at least five steps the
start of him, I do not think that he could have caught<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
me. If any man would run at all, I think this would
have been as good a cause as any he could have
wished for. I know, furthermore, that I would not
have been distanced in the race.”</p>

<p>In the meantime Watch returned.</p>

<p>“Heigh on, Watch!” cried the trapper. “Go
seek him out! Go seek him out!”</p>

<p>The dog was off in a jiffy, and descended to a large
mass of rocks where he could be heard worrying the
panther. The growling, snarling, and yelping soon
ceased, so Meshack hastened towards the sound. He
saw a den before him evidently in use for many years,
and in the opening lay the beast, stone dead. Watch
was licking his chops, as much as to say, “Now,
what do you think of me, old boy? Didn’t I do a
good day’s work, eh?”</p>

<p>Meshack was delighted, for the panther was evidently
an old stager. He was of tremendous size.
Many a dead deer had been found in this particular
part of the forest in years past, so it was evident that
the beast had ranged the woods for a long time.
After his death no more half-eaten deer were seen
in the woods by the hunters and backwoodsmen, so
it was plainly evident that the mighty panther had
been the cause of all this loss. Certainly the trapper
had had a dangerous encounter, and had had a narrow
escape from severe injuries.</p>

<p>Meshack had heard of a great den of bears on
Meadow Mountain, called the Big Gap, and on April
4th, 1803, he started out to hunt them with a friend
called Hugh. They were not long in reaching the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
ground where the bears had denned, or “holed,” as
the hunters called it. “It was,” says the trapper,
“the greatest place for bear holes I ever saw in my
life. I really believe that at least twenty had laid in
one acre of rock. They had all left their holes when
we arrived, in order to go out after acorns, except an
old female and her younglings, which were located
in a deep place in the rocks.”</p>

<p>The dogs soon found this family of bears and attacked
them, although the old one fought with great
fury, while her cubs ran for their lives. As they
passed by, Meshack shot at one and killed it, although
Hugh missed the one at which he fired. The old
bear had left her hole, meanwhile, and endeavored to
follow after her young, but the dogs worried her to
such an extent that she did not get out of sight of
the hole before she was shot dead at the first fire.
Two of the young ones escaped.</p>

<p>The two trappers continued their hunt, and in the
evening of the same day fell in with another old female
and two young bears. The dogs ran them all
up the same tree, but the laurel was so thick that as
soon as they shot the old one the young ones ran
safely away, while the dogs were worrying the
mother. The dogs soon finished the parent bear, and,
setting off after the two young cubs, drew so close
that they put up a tree. Running after them, the
trappers were not long in dispatching the two fugitives.
Thus, with two old bears, and three cubs, the
huntsmen felt that they had done a good day’s work.
With great difficulty the booty was carried home by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
means of two horses, and enough meat was thus secured
to last for the entire winter. Besides this, the
hides of the young cubs made an excellent carpet for
the cabin of the pioneers.</p>

<p>Soon afterwards Meshack purchased some cattle,
and, as there were scores of wolves about, on the
same night that he took his stock to his home he
missed one yearling, which he found had been killed
by a wolf. This made him very angry.</p>

<p>“Mr. Wolf shall pay me for my calf,” said he,
“and with interest.”</p>

<p>Taking a shoulder of the calf, he laid it in a steel
trap and placed the bait in a running branch of water,
taking care to hide it very securely. On the third
morning after putting out this snare he went to the
spot and found that the trap had disappeared.</p>

<p>Rain had fallen during the night and every trace
of the wolf’s footprints was destroyed. Nothing
daunted, Meshack returned home, called to both of
his dogs, and endeavored to lay them on the trail.
But they could not scent it on account of the great
rain.</p>

<p>The trapper knew that the wolf would go to the
nearest laurel swamp, to do which he had to cross a
creek. Into this the pioneer waded and walked down
it for some distance. Finally he saw where the trap
had struck the bank as the wolf was crossing the
stream. Wading back to the dogs, he carried them
to the other shore, and harked them on the track of
the wolf. At first the trail was very indistinct, but
as they went forward it became fresher and fresher.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>In about half an hour the dogs began to give
tongue and soon were hot on the scent of the wary
old fellow, who could not run very far because the
trap was fast to his hind legs. Finally there was a
terrible hullabaloo, and, running to the sound of the
noise, Meshack saw that the wolf had taken to a
hollow tree. His head was sticking out, and every
time a dog approached, he bit at him and howled dismally.</p>

<p>The dogs were not afraid of the beast, and kept
springing at him. Every time a dog would come near
enough the animal would snap viciously at him, and,
if possible, would sink every tooth in that part of his
body which he could reach. He was a terrible fellow,&mdash;black
and shaggy. Meshack encouraged his pets
to do all in their power, crying:</p>

<p>“Hark on, boys! Lay on to him! Fetch the old
varmint! Bite the old calf-killer. Hit him, boys!
Hit him!”</p>

<p>Finally the strongest dog took a deep hold on one
of the wolf’s ears, while the other seized the remaining
one. The wolf came out of the tree in a second,
but the now energetic attackers threw him to the
ground. Again and again he endeavored to recover
his feet, but they pulled him over and over. They
were all growing exhausted.</p>

<p>At this moment Meshack seized a club and took
part in the battle. Again and again he beat the old
fellow over the head. Again and again the dogs
rolled him about. At length the fierce and ferocious
beast gave a great, despairing kick, and it was all over.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>The trapper was delighted. Taking off the scalp
and hide, he returned to his cabin, and subsequently
sold both for nine dollars,&mdash;the price of two calves.</p>

<p>“My good wife,” said he, “I told you that I would
make Mr. Wolf pay me well, with interest, for his
incursions upon my cattle. I have done it.”</p>

<p>And his wife answered:</p>

<p>“Meshack, you are a man of your word&mdash;God
bless you!”</p>

<p>One other adventure of this famous trapper of the
Alleghanies is interesting, for he had another startling
experience. This time he was accompanied by
his good friend, Hugh, who was often his companion
in bear and wolf hunting.</p>

<p>Deciding to go after bear at the Big Gap, Hugh
and Meshack went into camp within three miles of
some rocks where many of these animals had previously
been seen in abundance. They arrived at the
hunting-grounds quite early, having one of their best
dogs along, a fellow who could handle almost any
bear, whatever his size. The animal grew very lively
when near some rocks, and soon ran into a hole,
where his yelping was intermingled with loud growls,
showing that some large animal was inside. Again
and again the trappers called to their faithful hound,
but he would not come out. There were three holes
out of which Mr. Bear might come bounding forth
at any moment.</p>

<p>Meshack had given Hugh a bayonet, fixed on a
handle like a pitchfork, with directions to run it
through the bear if he rushed by him. He, himself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
guarded the hole at which the animal was most likely
to appear. The dog was making a terrific noise, as
he struggled with the infuriated beast. The fight continued
for half an hour, at the end of which time
Meshack espied a part of the bear, when peering
through a small crack in the rock. Putting his musket
to the opening he fired. With a roar and rush
the wounded beast dashed into the open.</p>

<p>“Run your bayonet through him, Hugh!” yelled
the trapper. “Run your bayonet through him before
he gets away!”</p>

<p>But Hugh was too timid to make the attempt. The
enraged animal passed him with an evil snarl, and as
he scampered to a tree Meshack vainly endeavored
to ram another ball home in his rifle. The animal
climbed slowly up to a limb and lay there growling
evilly.</p>

<p>“Now is your chance, Meshack!” shouted Hugh.
“Get after him! Give him a dose of lead!”</p>

<p>The trapper approached in order to secure a bead
upon his victim, and, standing beneath the tree, was
just raising his rifle so as to take good aim, when,
with a mighty rush, Bruin came at him, through the
air. It was an unexpected attack, and quite out of
the ordinary, so you can well imagine what must the
feelings of the trapper have been, as the bear whirled
above his head. Stepping aside, he fired at the brown
mass just as it reached the ground.</p>

<p>The fighting beast made a savage stroke at the trapper’s
legs with his right paw, but Meshack was too
quick for him and jumped swiftly aside. Again and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
again the monster endeavored to get a blow in upon
the pioneer, but each time the trapper dodged. Just
then his dog appeared, seized Bruin by the hind leg,
causing the old fellow to turn about, and snap at his
antagonist. This gave the trapper a chance to load,
and, quickly ramming home another ball, he pointed
his flint-lock at the struggling beast, pulled the trigger,
and planted a bullet in his body near the heart. With
a savage growl of despair the bear dropped to the
ground, where the faithful dog soon terminated his
career.</p>

<p>“Hugh, where were you all this time?” asked the
smiling Meshack.</p>

<p>His companion approached; much abashed at the
small part he had taken in the fray.</p>

<p>“R-e-ally,” said he, “I feared that my weapon was
not sufficiently strong in order to dispatch this monster.
It might have bent, you know. Then, where
would I have been?”</p>

<p>Meshack laughed loudly.</p>

<p>“Well, I reckon, you would have been bent, too,”
said he. “For this fellow was surely a scrapper.
Here, help me swing him on a pole and we will take
him home for the winter’s supply of food.”</p>

<p>This they did, and Bruin increased very materially
the slender larder for the winter months, when snow
covered the trackless forests and it was impossible
to hunt, to fish, or to secure venison or bear-meat in
the deep and sombre woodland.</p>

<p>The early settlers, you see, being but few in numbers,
had a hard time to maintain themselves; if they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
had not been extremely economical they could not
have lived in the wilderness at all. They fashioned
their own clothes, they raised flax and wool, which
the women spun and wove into linen and linsey for
the men; and made flannel for their own wear. If
any man wished to hire help there would be an understanding
beforehand as to what the wages were to
be paid in. Sometimes pork, beef, honey, or corn
was used as a substitute for money. Sometimes a
calf, pig, deer-skin, bear-skin, coon-skin, or a wolf’s
scalp would suffice. The settlers all lived in cabins,
and fed their children on bread, meat, butter, honey,
and milk. Coffee and tea were almost out of the question.
A few of the older ladies, who had been raised
in other parts of the country, alone could use these
staples of diet. Meat was plentiful, for, if the farmers
could keep the wild animals away from their hogs,
the nuts and acorns would make them very fat. Pork,
beef, bear-meat, and venison were easily obtained.
Wild meat was not thought very much of, because it
was most plentiful at all times.</p>

<p>Politics were little understood among the men in
buckskin. Most of them were Federalists. An election
was usually held on the first Monday in October,
when all the settlers would gather at the polling
booths, arrayed in hunting-shirt and moccasins, almost
every one of them with a big knife stuck in his belt.
A stranger would have thought this some military
party going to war, and, if a quarrel occurred, the
two contestants would rip off both coat and shirt, and
fight until one or the other acknowledged that he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
the beaten individual. Then their friends would take
the bleeding combatants to the nearest stream and
give them both a good washing. This would usually
end the quarrel. The people were generous to strangers
travelling through the country, and if a wayfarer
lost his path a hunter would pilot him five, six,
or even ten miles, until he was out of danger of being
lost. They would refuse all compensation for their
services.</p>

<p>In such a community Meshack Browning continued
his life, and, in spite of numerous hairbreadth escapes
from wounded bears and panthers, successfully escaped
from any serious injuries, and he did not kill
merely for the sake of killing. Honest and warm
sentiments stirred his bosom, as the following story
will show.</p>

<p>One day he was following a large buck, which ran
into a crevice in some high rocks and there lay down.
The trapper hurried after him, and, mounting a large
boulder, eagerly searched for a view of the cunning
animal. He stood on the rock and looked about him
with the utmost care, but could see nothing of the
buck, until casting his eyes down at the base of the
rock directly below where he stood, there lay the fine
fellow contentedly chewing his cud, apparently considering
himself perfectly secure. He was watching
the ground in front, not thinking that an enemy could
approach on the side which the rocks so completely
covered. Let me here quote the old trapper:</p>

<p>“The rock being fully twenty feet high, I was
obliged to shoot nearly straight down, but when I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
saw what a complete advantage I had, it greatly
marred my pleasure to think that such a noble animal,
possessing all the beauty bestowed by a pair of fine,
large horns, a well formed body, and tapering limbs;
whose life had been innocently spent (never having
committed an injury against either man or beast)
should be thus sacrified. My desire of killing him
was so weakened, that I really had thought of letting
him escape the death that was then hanging over him,
but again it occurred to me that he was one of the
creatures placed here for the use of man, that, if I
let him go, probably the next hunter who caught him
in his power would surely kill him, and that it would
be as well for me to take him as to let any other person
have him.</p>

<p>“So, taking a good aim, I fired at this monarch of
the forest, when the poor fellow gave a few jumps,
and fell dead. I declare the death of that deer gave
me more real pain than pleasure. He was a large, old
fellow, his head and his face being quite gray with
age. I took his skin and returned to my cabin, having
the river to wade and at least a mile to travel
before I could reach home. The winter being then
near, I believe that the death of this buck ended the
fall hunt.”</p>

<p>The seasoned trapper was not always accustomed
to shoot bears. Sometimes he would trap them in
large log traps, hewn out of the forest timber by
means of the axe. To entice the animals into this
box, he used to roast the leg of a deer, and, while the
meat was cooking, he would rub honey over it, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
that it would smell very strongly of the latter. Then
he would cut off pieces of this sweetened meat, would
tie them beneath his moccasins, would walk through
the grounds which the bears frequented and would
return to the trap. Every bear which smelled his
tracks would follow the trail to the trap and would
get caught in it.</p>

<p>Shooting wolves was also varied by trapping
wolves, and for this he used to take a carcass of a cow
or a horse, and lay it in a small stream of water.
Then he would go off some distance, so that the wolf
could not see where, and would cut bushes. He would
stick the ends in the mud so thickly that the wolf
could get at the meat only in one place, which was
left open and clear. The carcass was so laid that the
wolf could eat at either side.</p>

<p>A wolf will never jump over the bait, but will hunt
the stream for a place to cross, in order to go around
the other side, and eat. Therefore, the wise trapper
would leave a passage for the animal to cross the
water, and would set bushes about so thickly that they
could not get through in any other place. The stream
would then be widened where the wolves would pass,
so that they could not step over it, and a flat stone
be placed in the centre with green moss laid on top,
so that it would look as if it had never been moved.
Then meat would be cut into small pieces, and strewn
on both sides of these crossing-places, both above and
below the carcass.</p>

<p>When a gang of wolves would come to the meat
the larger ones would drive the smaller ones off.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
These would run about seeking food, and, soon finding
the small pieces strewn about the crossing-places,
they would run across, stepping upon the moss-covered
stone as they did so. Every time they returned they
would be sure to go over the place, setting their feet
precisely in the same position on the stone.</p>

<p>The trapper would carefully watch the marks of
the presence of the wolves. When he found that they
made tracks on the stone by wearing away the moss
with their feet he would remove the stone and put a
steel trap in its place, covering it over with green
moss just as he had covered the stone. When the
animals came back, in order to seek food, they would
cross as before, place their feet in the trap, and would
be securely caught. The old ones, being at the meat
when a young one would be caught in the trap, would
not be afraid to return,&mdash;as there was nothing to
scare them. After a while, however, all would
become afraid of the crossing-places. Then wise
Meshack would place his trap in the mud where they
would stand to eat the meat. But after one was
caught in this place, all would desert, and trapping
would be over with this particular gang of wolves.</p>

<p>After capturing them in this manner for several
years they became so cunning that they would not
touch any bait which was offered them. The trapper
therefore adopted another plan, which was as follows:</p>

<p>He found that they would pick up any fragments
of old bones that lay upon the ground, but if they lay
in water, or close to it, they would not touch them.
He therefore saved all the large bones from the table,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
particularly the joint ends of beef bones. He would
beat them to pieces, mount his horse, so that his
tracks would not be scented, and would scatter the
stuff over a considerable area of land. Around this
space he would then stick some bushes; so that the
wolves, in order to get at the mess, would have to
pass through an opening in the brush.</p>

<p>The wolves would soon find the bones and eat them
up. Then they would be given a second meal. But,
meanwhile, a trap would be placed at the opening of
the bushes and would be stuck in a hole of its own
size. All the extra dirt would be carried away. The
trap would be pressed down an inch below the surface.
Old leaves would then be laid over it, and it would
also be covered with an inch of buckwheat bran, which
would keep the wolves from smelling the iron. Then
the skillful trapper would take some of the grass,
which grew around the spot, and lay it carefully over
the trap, so that no eye would discern the difference
between that particular place and the surrounding
earth. When this was done early in the morning,
or before a shower of rain which would destroy all
smell, a wolf would be always caught as he came up
in search of the little bones. The pioneer was most
successful in this method of defeating the cunning
of the shy and treacherous animals, who were so destructive
to the live stock of the settlers that a considerable
sum was paid for their scalps.</p>

<p>That the wolves were fearless the following story
will bear full witness:</p>

<p>A friend of the trapper’s called Mr. Calmes, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
travelling from Virginia to Kentucky with a number
of others, at a time when the Indians were very
troublesome. In passing through the wilderness they
saw so many trails of the red men that they were
afraid to keep a fire burning at night for fear that
the prowling savages might see their light and attack
them by surprise. They would therefore let their
wood burn until their supper was cooked, then they
would smother the embers and lie down in the dark.</p>

<p>One night they heard an animal moving around
them, and seizing their guns, made ready to shoot it.
But the animal, whatever it was, made off in the
woodland. By its tracks they could see that it was
a huge wolf. After the excitement had subsided they
all lay down again to sleep, and one of them so
stretched himself upon the ground that his head was
exposed outside of the camp. When he was asleep
the wolf returned, and, creeping upon him stealthily,
bit him so severely about the head that he died before
daybreak, without speaking a word to his anxious
companions. Mr. Calmes often said that had this
ferocious animal found a man in the woods by himself,
and if it was at a time when he was particularly
hungry, he would have fallen upon him and would
have killed him at once. He wound up this grewsome
yarn with the sage advice to the trapper to kill all the
wolves that he could.</p>

<p>“Browning,” said he, “your hunting is really a
great service to this country, for, if you come upon
one of these sneaking wolves, you must spare no pain
to kill him. There is no knowing how many cattle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
sheep, and hogs you will thus save to the inhabitants.
I was going to tell you to be prepared for them, but
I know that you understand the rascals and will take
care of yourself. Whatever you do, do not let one
of these bad fellows escape if you can help it.”</p>

<p>Meshack Browning did not do so. His long and
active life was one of constant battling with the wild
animals of the Blue Ridge, and at the close of his
career all could justly say that nowhere had a more
famous huntsman ever lived in the eastern portion
of the then half-settled United States. Now little
game is to be found where once deer, wolves, bears,
and wild cats were plentiful, and, although sturdy
and honest men still reside in the Alleghanies, seldom
does one meet with a character like this bluff old
trapper and pioneer.</p>

<h2 class="p4">“BILL” BENT:</h2>

<p class="pch">HERO OF THE OLD SANTA FÉ TRAIL</p>

<p class="drop-cap03">WHAT one of the plainsmen did not know
“Bill” Bent; “Bill,” the fellow who had
battled so often with the Comanches,
Kiowas, and other Indians that they called him “The
Red Panther:” “Bill,” who had killed innumerable
braves in open conflict; and “Bill” who had often
just escaped the scalping-knife by a mere hair’s
breadth? The old fellow was a true plains’ hero, and
after you have heard some of the stories about his
escapades with the redskins I’ll warrant that you will
agree that he was a marvellously lucky scout.</p>

<p>In 1829 the brother of this fellow&mdash;Charles Bent&mdash;was
upon an expedition to the mountains near
Santa Fé, New Mexico. With him were numerous
others, well armed and well mounted. It was lucky
that this was the case, for every day a cloud of
Comanches and Kiowas hung upon the flanks of the
moving line of trappers and kept up a continuous and
rapid fire. Every night the trappers slept upon their
arms, certain that an assault would come before the
dawn. Bill Bent was several miles away&mdash;at a little
frontier post&mdash;and, hearing of the peril of his
brother and his friends, determined to ride to the
rescue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>Old Bill rode a large black mule with split ears,
which showed that he had once been owned by a
Comanche brave. The Comanches soon sighted him,
and about fifty of them made after him at full tilt.
Arrows and bullets whistled about the head of the
gallant scout, but he paid no more attention to these
missiles than if they were flies. Occasionally he
would turn in his saddle and drop some too eager
buck whose zeal had outstripped discretion, and who
had galloped within easy range of Bill’s deadly
Hawken rifle.</p>

<p>“Here he comes, boys!” shouted one of the band
of plainsmen. “A brave fellow is after us, sure.”</p>

<p>Bent came dashing up and reached two plainsmen
called Coates and Waldo, who fired at the pursuing
redskins, bringing down three of the foremost. Seeing
this, the other Comanches retreated and left the
little band to plod on alone. A force of one hundred
and twenty Mexicans joined the party shortly afterwards,
in order to be protected by them against the
overwhelming numbers of the redskins.</p>

<p>The frontiersmen kept on their way across the lava
dust and sage brush, but the Indians&mdash;although
drawing off at a distance&mdash;still pursued. A famous
scout called Ewing Young was travelling about twenty
miles off, and from a fleeing Mexican heard that his
brother trappers were sorely pressed. This particular
scout was one of the bravest and most generous of
men. As a trapper, hunter, and Indian fighter, he
had few superiors. He had learned from a friendly
redskin that the mountain canyon towards which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
scouts were journeying was occupied by two thousand
warriors, who lay in ambush waiting to entrap and
annihilate the whites. Gathering forty trusty men-of-the-plains
around him he rode to warn the fleeing
plainsmen of their danger.</p>

<p>“By George, boys, there they are!”</p>

<p>One of the advance trappers spoke thus, as&mdash;from
a summit of a high hill&mdash;he saw below him the vast
horde of redskins surrounding and following the retreating
scouts with whom Bill Bent was associated.
The redskins set up a wild whooping as soon as they
viewed the oncoming whites. “Crack! crack!” the
rifles began to spit and spatter at the advancing plainsmen.</p>

<p>The scouts were courageous, but the odds were too
great even for such valor as theirs. Swarms of Indians
enveloped them, shouting:</p>

<p>“Ki yi! ki yi! The palefaces will soon all be
dead!”</p>

<p>At this juncture young Kit Carson first showed the
material that he was made of. Riding out in front,
he swung himself under his horse,&mdash;and shooting at
a redskin from below its neck, brought him to the
ground.</p>

<p>“Bully for you, Kit!” shouted Scout Young.
“But these infernal redskins are too thick for me. I
must break loose and retreat to Tavo.”</p>

<p>This the plainsman speedily did, and, although pursued
for some distance, finally got safely away. At
Tavo a crowd of trappers were assembled for their
yearly rendezvous. Ninety-five of them joined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
Young, crying: “To the rescue of Bill Bent! To the
fore! We’ll clean up all the Comanches in the state!”</p>

<p>“Hurrah, boys!” shouted Young. “That’s the
kind of talk I like to hear. We’ll get right after
them.”</p>

<p>The Indians, meanwhile, still pursued Bill Bent and
his party.</p>

<p>The trappers under Young were not long in riding
to the rescue of their comrades. As they came in
sight the redskins gave whoops of disgust, for they
saw that they were outnumbered and outclassed.</p>

<p>“Back to the woods!” shouted young Kit Carson,
as he galloped his steed in the direction of the braves.
“Back to the plains, for we’ll get you now!”</p>

<p>As the party came on, Bill Bent’s followers set up
a wild whooping. “We’re saved!” cried several.
“Old Scout Young, we knew, would not let us be
annihilated.”</p>

<p>The Indians now became dispirited. Seeing the
reinforcements coming up in battle array they quickly
retired, chanting a death song, for they had lost fully
fifty men in killed and wounded.</p>

<p>Bill Bent’s followers were now free, and Bill, himself,
was overjoyed to have saved his scalp. But he
soon came near losing it again.</p>

<p>In the winter of 1830-1831, the tried and seasoned
trapper, together with Robert Isaacs and a comrade
whose name is unknown, made his way to Arizona,
on a trapping expedition. For a time they met with
fair success and saw nothing of the redskins. But
one day they were surrounded by a body of Mescalero<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
Apaches, who were the fiercest of the savage tribes
upon the frontier. The Indians were one hundred and
fifty strong. There were but three trappers. What
chance had they, you ask. They had no hope of freedom,
but, as Bill Bent expressed it: “We will sell
our lives as dearly as possible and we will make as
many redskins go under as we can before we, ourselves,
will give up!”</p>

<p>The trappers threw up a rude stone breastwork
when first surrounded. They were working hard on
this, when, with terrific whoops, the Apaches were
after them on the charge.</p>

<p>“Go easy, boys!” shouted Bill Bent. “Make every
shot count!”</p>

<p>Two of the trappers fired as he spoke and two of
the chiefs fell to the sod. Before they could get out
of range the third man shot off his rifle, and another
one of the braves dropped to the ground. The
Apaches were not disconcerted and again returned to
the charge, but they were met by the deadly fire of the
reloaded rifles and the pistols of the trappers, also.</p>

<p>“Ugh! Ugh!” said they, “we’ve had enough!
We must go back!”</p>

<p>Conducting the siege now at long range, the
Apaches kept up a desultory fire for two days. Then
they retired in disgust, for they could not dislodge the
trappers.</p>

<p>“Hurrah!” cried Bill Bent, as he saw them going
away. “Boys, we can now get some water!”</p>

<p>The scouts, in fact, were nearly dead with thirst,
but they soon found a spring and refreshed themselves.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
Leaving Arizona soon afterwards, they avoided any
further trouble with the terrible Apaches, who, remembering
the drubbing which they had received,
were glad to allow them to retreat unmolested.</p>

<p>The old Santa Fé trail in New Mexico was much
used by emigrants at this time and was well watched
by the redskins. Should a train be slightly guarded
it would be unsafe for men, women and children, for
the Indians would make short work of them. This
deterred all except the boldest spirits from venturing
where was certain peril and probable death. But
among the heroes who were still willing to encounter
the fearful odds of Indian combat were to be found
Bill Bent, his brother Charles, the Waldos, and a few
others whom no danger ever daunted, and who saw
a splendid field for trade in this country. In 1839 a
party of these men applied to Andrew Jackson, who
had just taken his seat as President. They asked
for a military escort to accompany them to the Arkansas
River, which&mdash;at that time&mdash;formed the
boundary between Mexico and the United States.</p>

<p>This request was speedily granted, and Major Bennett
Riley was detailed, with two hundred men, to
meet the emigrants at Fort Leavenworth and to accompany
them to the Arkansas River. The traders
met at Round Grove, Missouri, where Charles Bent
was chosen Captain and where Bill Bent also joined.
With thirty-six wagons, fully freighted with valuable
goods, they set out for Santa Fé, New Mexico.</p>

<p>In due time they reached the Arkansas River at
Chateau’s Island, and here the traders bade farewell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
to the gallant Major and his brave soldiers. Plunging
into the shallow waters of the stream they were soon
on Mexican soil. But their troubles now commenced.
The dry sand engulfed their wagon wheels almost to
the hubs, stalling the teams, and utterly preventing
an orderly march.</p>

<p>“Close up! Close up!” Bill Bent kept shouting.</p>

<p>But in spite of these orders, the wagons were soon
strung over a half a mile of road. Advance and rear
detachments had been thrown out to guard against
surprise, but either through the negligence of the
videttes, or from the completeness with which the
Indians had concealed themselves, they had only gone
nine miles when the savages seemed to spring out of
the very bowels of the earth. Their rifles spat a
deadly fire.</p>

<p>“My stars, look at the redskins!” cried Bill Bent.
“They’re after us, for sure, this time!”</p>

<p>The surprise had been complete, but Charles Bent&mdash;mounted
upon a large, black horse&mdash;with his long,
dark hair floating upon the wind, dashed up and down
the line, forming his men. Every ravine swarmed
with the redskins, and, although they yelled fiercely,
above their loud calls could be heard the voice of
Charles Bent.</p>

<p>“Close up, men! Close up!” he kept shouting.
“It’s our only chance! And keep cool! Keep cool!”</p>

<p>Two of the men had been lagging in the rear of the
train, and, at the first fire, one fell dead, while the
other&mdash;with fifty Indians in pursuit&mdash;dashed for
the wagons. Escape seemed to be impossible, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
Bent saw the situation at a glance and charged
towards the advancing savages with twenty scouts.
The Indians drew off at this show of force, and
the fleeing trapper was thus able to join his comrades.</p>

<p><i>Crash! Crash!</i> sounded the rifles, and the battle
continued to rage with fury. Nothing but Bent’s
coolness and the desperate bravery of his men prevented
a charge by the red men, who numbered at
least a thousand. Luckily a small, brass cannon was
in the train&mdash;the first that ever crossed the Arkansas&mdash;and,
as it spat its fire, the Comanches withdrew.</p>

<p>The trappers now dug rifle-pits, but Bent soon saw
that without water his men would be unable to hold
their own.</p>

<p>“Who will creep through the hostile redskins and
go after Major Riley and his men?” he asked. “Unless
we get his aid we will have to give in to these
frightfully bloodthirsty savages!”</p>

<p>“I will go! I will go!” came from the throats of
many. In fact all seemed to wish to undertake the
hazardous journey.</p>

<p>Captain Bent could not help laughing. Nine were
finally selected for the trip. They knew that their
only salvation lay in their rifles, for their mules were
so worn down by fatigue that flight was out of the
question.</p>

<p>They rode out expecting to have a tough time of it,
but the redskins allowed them to pass through their
lines without firing a single shot at them. Spurring
on their broken-down beasts they hastened towards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
the Arkansas River, where they still hoped to find
Major Riley with his troops.</p>

<p>The Major was surely there. He saw them coming
away off on the plains, and, striking his tents, was
all prepared to meet them when they arrived.</p>

<p>“Gentlemen,” said he, when he heard their story,
“it is a breach of national etiquette for me to cross
the boundary line into Mexico&mdash;a friendly power&mdash;but
blood is thicker than water, and I cannot see my
countrymen suffer. I will be with you as soon as my
troops can pack up.”</p>

<p>The soldiers were soon on their way. So rapid and
silent was the approach of the force that they even
penetrated between the pickets of the traders and their
camp before they were discovered. Cheer after cheer
welled from the throats of the beleaguered plainsmen,
as they approached. The savages heard them, and,
seeing that they now would have to assume the defensive,
quietly slipped away.</p>

<p>“Ow! Ow!” said one brave. “We get those
palefaces yet.”</p>

<p>Much overjoyed, Bent and his traders again started
on their journey, turning their course from Santa Fé,
which point they at first intended to reach, to Taos,
some eighty miles further to the North. By this
détour they not only avoided many canyons, in which
were sure to be lurking savages, but were also able
to obtain a military escort of Mexicans. A General
Viscarro&mdash;with a goodly number of Mexican rancheros&mdash;accompanied
them. But there was still to
be trouble.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>They reached the rippling courses of the river Cimarron.
There a party of savages approached the
Mexicans, who rode on in front. One of them bore
an arrow tied transversely across a spear, it being the
symbol of the cross. Viscarro was a Catholic, and,
honoring this novel flag with true devotion, he was
spoken to by one of the braves.</p>

<p>“If the Americans will move aside to some distance,”
said he, “we will lay down our arms and will
surrender.”</p>

<p>Viscarro smiled.</p>

<p>“Certainly, red brother,” said he.</p>

<p>The Americans retired beyond a ridge, and no
sooner were they out of the way than the treacherous
savages poured a destructive fire into the Mexican
ranks. Many men and officers were wounded. But
luckily the two Bents heard the firing, and suspecting
treachery, gathered a number of mounted soldiers and
went to the relief of the men who lived south of the
Rio Grande.</p>

<p>Now was a desperate affair. Bent and his men burst
upon the savages with fierce cries and delivered a
deadly volley right in their faces. Their rifles were
then discarded, and, having next emptied their pistols,
they followed up the attack with tomahawks and
clubbed rifles. Soon the Comanches were in full flight
and the field was strewn thickly with their dead and
wounded.</p>

<p>A gallant action was performed by a Pueblo (or
Village) Indian. He was near the Mexican General,
Viscarro, and understanding the language of the hostiles,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
heard one of the latter exclaim in his native
tongue: “Now for the General!” As he spoke he
aimed a bullet at the body of the Mexican commander.
The Indian threw himself in front of him&mdash;at this
juncture&mdash;and fell to the ground; as noble a hero
as the lists of chivalry tell of. Viscarro was much
affected by this show of devotion.</p>

<p>Thanks to Bill Bent and his brother Charles, the
caravan had been saved from the hostiles. It was
well. From this time on nothing exciting occurred
and the Americans and Mexicans reached their respective
homes in safety, meeting with no more serious
annoyance than the nightly serenade of coyotes.
The disheartened Comanches had given up their attempt
to crush out the travel along the Arkansas trail,
and fortunately for the white traders entered into no
more military combinations,&mdash;preferring the safer
and more natural warfare of the small, predatory
bands. They could then move quickly and could cut
off small unguarded bodies of men.</p>

<p>Bill Bent had done well. Now he did even better,
for a fort was named after him. This was situated
on the Arkansas River; was first called Fort William,
and was the property of Lieutenant Vrain and himself.
Built in 1833, here the celebrated Kit Carson
was the post hunter from 1834 to 1842. Could the
walls of the old fort speak, they would tell many tales
of thrilling battles with the red men.</p>

<p>On one occasion it was besieged by many thousands
of plains Indians. All of the tribes had determined
to lay aside their mutual dislike for one another for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
once, and to league together for the extermination of
the “palefaces.” They saw that the white traders
would soon have all of this country and they did not
like the idea. Bill Bent was approaching the fort with
a wagon-train about this time. Knowing that two or
three hundred raw recruits of the United States garrison
formed its only defense, he hastened rapidly to
its relief. On his way he met several deserters, who
(in the night) had scaled the walls of what they regarded
to be a place of doom, and stealing cautiously
through the savage lines, had fled with all speed
towards the rising sun,&mdash;for they knew that help was
there.</p>

<p>Bill Bent was somewhat alarmed at this. When
he arrived in sight of the fort he saw that it was menaced
by a great and awful danger. There were thousands
of hostile Indians dancing their war and scalp
dances around it, and endeavoring to work themselves
up to the proper frenzy in order to make the attack.
Bent’s blood began to boil.</p>

<p>“Here!” he cried to one of his best men, “you
take charge of the train! I have to move forward!”</p>

<p>His hat came off as he rode on, but he galloped
straight at the fort. His long hair&mdash;meanwhile&mdash;trailed
out behind like a banner from its staff. It was
a trophy which any of the savages would have been
very proud to wear in his belt.</p>

<p>The Indians were too surprised to fire at him. As
he dashed along, he uttered a fierce war-whoop, and
fired his revolver at a savage who was unwise enough
to approach. Behind him came thundering his friend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
and ally,&mdash;Yellow Bear. He was a great Apache
chief, but a friend of the whites and their staunch supporter.
Strung out in the rear were a few Apache
braves, who would have cheerfully sacrificed their
lives for either Bent or Yellow Bear.</p>

<p>Bill Bent reached the fort in safety. So did Yellow
Bear and his braves. The wagon-train came steadily
on, its men marching alongside, fully armed. It, too,
reached the doorway of the fort without a mishap.
Here the pioneers found Bent getting everything in
proper shape to give a warm reception to the braves,
who from their actions were apparently ready for
the assault. They were met with a hot reception.</p>

<p>Now an unforeseen event occurred.</p>

<p>Upon the morning after Bent’s arrival the lookout
beheld a slight cloud of dust far to the Eastward.
After a while, a few black specks could be seen. They
came nearer and were seen to be Indian videttes with
their ponies on a dead run.</p>

<p>The videttes dashed into the Indian encampment,
said a few hasty words to some of the chiefs, and
then consternation seemed to take possession of the
redskins. The squaws began at once to take down the
lodges. The travois poles were slung with the tents
and equipment. Soon the entire Indian camp was in
full retreat. Amidst the yelping of the dogs, squalling
of the babies, the rattle of pots and kettles piled up
on the travois, and the insulting yells of the warriors,
the savage host of besiegers crossed the Arkansas
River and disappeared from view.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why, now,” said Bill Bent. “Boys! Seems
they’re afraid of us!”</p>

<p>But the mystery was soon explained. Late on the
evening of the next day those in the fort beheld the
approach of a regiment of United States cavalry,
which had been sent to its relief. The redskins had
an admirable picket system. By means of this their
pony express had told them of the approach of the
cavalry, and, fearing that vengeance might be taken
upon them for their hostile attitude and war-like
threats, they prudently decamped.</p>

<p>Bill Bent had many another adventure upon the
plains which was as thrilling as this. He was known
for his courage and was never badly wounded, although
he took a thousand chances. Sad to relate,
he married a Cheyenne wife, and his children&mdash;suffering
from this taint of redskin blood&mdash;never attained
the prominence upon the plains which their
fond parent had held. At last the good old fellow
passed to the Happy Hunting Grounds. He had
indeed seen the wild and woolly West in its palmiest
days. Good-by to old Bill, hardy frontiersman and
scout, whose reputation was spotless! Good-by and
good luck, Bill Bent!</p>

<h2 class="p4">THOMAS EDDIE:</h2>

<p class="pch">THE LAST OF THE OLD SCHOOL
TRAPPERS</p>

<p class="drop-cap03">“YOU will do, boy, I will need you!”</p>

<p class="pn">The man who spoke&mdash;a grizzled old
plainsman&mdash;nodded to a strong-looking
young Scotchman who was standing before him, rifle
in hand, and motioned to him to take a position among
a number of trappers who stood near by. The fellow
who thus spoke was John Ashley (a famous trader
and explorer) who had just organized the Rocky
Mountain Fur Company. As he was in need of vigorous
young men his heart naturally warmed towards
the stalwart youth before him, who was yearning for
adventure in the Far West.</p>

<p>This athletic frontiersman was none other than
Thomas Eddie, who was now twenty-four years of
age, and whose aim with the rifle was steady and sure.
Born on August 29th, 1799, he had naturally drifted
to the plains, where he was as quick to volunteer upon
a dangerous mission as were “Old Bill” Williams,
Bill Gordon, or any of the other valiant pioneers.
He was a fellow of iron will, and the older members
of this expedition soon found that the canny young
Scot would do and dare as much as any of them. As
ready and willing to go to the relief of a stricken comrade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
as the most experienced man on the plains, he
had not an enemy on the border, except among the
redskins, whose hand was against every white man.
As wiry as steel, as keen as a sword blade: such was
the youthful Thomas Eddie, soon to be the hero of
many a startling adventure.</p>

<p>The trappers under Ashley made their way up the
waters of the Missouri in keel-boats. The muddy
current of the turbid stream raged furiously against
them, but by vigorous rowing they managed to thread
their way among the numerous snags and sand-bars.
At length they reached the vicinity of an Arickara
village, filled with several hundred savages, and here
they intended to trade, before passing up the Yellowstone
River, where was splendid trapping. They
rowed on with confidence, little suspecting that the
redskins were in a terrible state of agitation and anger
against all of the white men of the West. In fact,
not many weeks before, an adventurous trapper, who
had been travelling near by, had caught the son of the
head chief of this nation, as he was stealing his horse.
He had shot him down as he was in the act of throwing
his leg over his mount. The Arickaras had soon
heard of this, and, in spite of the fact that the white
man had been perfectly justified in killing the horse-thief,
determined to avenge the death of their comrade.</p>

<p>Ashley and his companions did not know of this
adventure. Therefore they rowed onward with confidence,
and soon sighted the tepees of the red men
on the right bank of the stream.</p>

<p>“There they are!” cried Eddie, who was in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
bow of one of the boats. “We will have good trade,
for I know that they are greatly in need of arms and
of ammunition.”</p>

<p>“Look out for them!” spoke a fellow named Rose,
in one of the other vessels. “From certain signs I
know that the red vermin mean mischief.”</p>

<p>This fellow was a Kentuckian who, for some misdemeanor,
had been outlawed in his own state and had
then lived among the Crow Indians, who had made
him a chief. Ashley did not like him and believed
him to be a villain. Eddie, however, knew that he
spoke with keen knowledge of the redskins. He,
therefore, turned around and cried loudly:</p>

<p>“Ashley, look out for the Indians! They mean
mischief!”</p>

<p>To this, the head of the expedition paid not the
slightest attention. Instead, he pushed forward, anchored
his boat close in shore, near a long strip of
small cottonwood trees, and pulled out his pipe, smoking
it complacently.</p>

<p>“Be ready for an ambush,” said Rose, “I know
that the Arickaras are in an ugly mood.”</p>

<p>“Oh, pshaw!” answered Ashley. “The red men
are over anxious to trade. It has been ten years since
they have been on the war-path against the whites
and I know that they will treat us well. Why, man,
these Indians love me like a brother.”</p>

<p>Rose frowned.</p>

<p>“I have lived among these redskins for many
moons,” said he. “And I know them like a book.
Look out. They mean trouble!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>Ashley again pooh-poohed the idea, and rowed to
the bank, where he deposited his articles of trade upon
several gaudy blankets. The Arickaras crowded
around him, crying:</p>

<p>“Oh, palefaced brother, you have brought us fine
things. Oh, good brother! Oh, kind brother!”</p>

<p>They showed feverish anxiety to obtain guns and
ammunition, saying that they were soon going against
their old enemies, the Sioux. The trade went on,
many of the trappers coming ashore in order to better
bargain with the redskins; a few, however, remaining
in the boats. Ashley seemed to be well satisfied
with the manner in which everything was going.
He suspected nothing until one of his men came to
him and whispered in his ear:</p>

<p>“Three of our trappers have secretly disappeared,
and I fear that they have been murdered.”</p>

<p>The leader of the Rocky Mountain Fur Company
was at last alarmed. He made preparations for defense
and gathered his men about him in a hollow
square. But the Indians, finding that they no longer
could conceal their enmity, now set up a loud whooping
and yelling. A shot was fired. Another and
another followed in quick succession, and the cottonwood
thickets swarmed with the savages, who poured
a rain of bullets at the trappers upon the bank and
upon those in the boats.</p>

<p>“Drop to the ground, boys!” shouted Ashley, “and
we will fight for our lives.”</p>

<p>A desperate encounter ensued. Although surrounded
in the rear, the trappers fought their way to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
the bank, jumped into the river, and attempted to
swim to their boats. Many were drowned, others
were killed by bullets as they splashed towards their
craft, but the majority clambered aboard in safety.</p>

<p>“Cut the ropes,” shouted Ashley, “and get away
from here as quickly as you are able!”</p>

<p>Under a terrific fire the boats began to slowly drift
down the river. Oars were soon run out and the
trappers were well beyond range of the murderous
Arickara rifles. Of one hundred and forty-nine men
they had lost sixty killed and drowned, and scarcely
one of them did not bear marks of bullet or arrow
wounds. It had been a desperate affair. Had the
confident Ashley but listened to the sage advice of
the Crow renegade there would have been no such
slaughter. Thus ended the famous stampede of the
Rocky Mountain Fur Company, on the ninth day of
March, 1828.</p>

<p>But how about the stalwart young Eddie? This
lucky plainsman escaped with only one arrow wound
in his forearm. He was heroic in the defense of the
boats, and, taking charge of one of them, managed
to get her safely to Council Bluffs, where the Fur
Company retreated in good order. Poor, old trappers!
They had met with a warmer reception than
they had bargained for!</p>

<p>As luck would have it, a Colonel Leavenworth was
then at Council Bluffs with a detachment of United
States troopers. Ashley soon told him his story, and
wound up his sad tale with the request that he help
him to chastise the savages.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>“That I will do right willingly,” answered the gallant
soldier. “White Bear, with his band of Sioux
warriors, will go with me, I know. He says that he
is just itching for a little brush with the Arickaras.
He will be of great assistance to us.”</p>

<p>Eddie joined the detachment as it departed, and,
marching speedily towards the village, the soldiers
and allied Sioux found the Arickaras abandoning it.
A sharp skirmish took place; the soldiers and trappers
fell upon the rear guard, and, routing it speedily,
dashed among the tepees, which were set on fire and
quickly consumed. The Arickaras fled across the
prairie. As the skirmish was in progress White Bear,
the Sioux leader, was the hero of a desperate affair,
which made him always well known among the whites,
and greatly respected by all of the valiant men of the
frontier.</p>

<p>While the fight was at its hottest this Sioux chieftain
singled out a giant Arickara warrior, rushed upon
him, tomahawk in hand, and cried out:</p>

<p>“If you are a man, halt and struggle with me. We
will see which is the better.”</p>

<p>The Arickara had a bow in his hand, and, turning
upon the Bear, sent a shower of arrows whistling
around him. One of them pierced his thigh, but the
Sioux stopped and pulled the missile from the wound.
Then, with tomahawk upraised, he charged upon his
enemy.</p>

<p>The Arickara chief had discharged his last arrow,
and, seeing that it was too late to fly, wheeled and
faced his antagonist. He was a large and powerful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
man, but the Sioux warrior was more agile. Uttering
a loud and discordant yell, White Bear rushed at his
foe. All the other combatants stopped for a moment,
in order to view this strange and startling contest.</p>

<p>The sun gleamed upon the tomahawks of the two
braves as they danced around each other. Again and
again each endeavored to strike a blow, but, by skillful
dodging, the weapon was evaded, and the warriors
continued to prance about in a circle. Suddenly the
Sioux bent over and struck the Arickara warrior a
fierce stroke upon the knee; so fierce, indeed, that he
nearly severed his leg from his body. White Bear
leaped forward, dodged sideways, and evaded the
descending tomahawk of the Arickara chieftain. The
latter tottered and then fell to the ground.</p>

<p>Before he could recover, the Sioux had dealt a
death-blow, and, amidst the wild yelling and screeching
of the spectators, deftly scalped his enemy, holding
the top-knot aloft, and himself uttering the wild
yelp of triumph. “Um-Yah! Um-Yah! Uh-Yah!”</p>

<p>The Arickaras were dispersed and well punished
for their attack upon Ashley and his men. The troops
returned in triumph to Council Bluffs, and Eddie was
congratulated by the head trapper for his part in the
affair.</p>

<p>“But now, my boy,” said the veteran plainsman,
“I want you to go up the Yellowstone, cross the
mountains, and, with fourteen others, bring back a
whole lot of peltries.”</p>

<p>“I’m your man,” said Eddie. “I’m off as soon as
you say the word.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>The fourteen trappers moved to the Yellowstone,
where they hunted and trapped with great success,
until winter. Then they made their way to the village
of some friendly Crows. They were treated with
kindness and hospitality, and had great good luck in
procuring beaver peltries. When spring came they
travelled towards the Rocky Mountains, after making
appropriate speeches of friendship to their hosts, and
giving them many presents.</p>

<p>In the mountains their old enemies&mdash;the Blackfeet&mdash;were
very mischievous. They often stole their
traps, attempted to stampede their ponies, and fired
at them from ambush. Nearly every night the alarm
would sound: “Indians! Indians! Look to your
horses!” And, during the day, the Blackfoot sentinels
could be seen upon the skyline, perched upon the
summit of some high hill. They would signal to their
friends in the valleys below and tell them of the progress
of the trappers. The pioneers were repeatedly
ambushed, but they marched valiantly on, fighting as
they went. At last they left the mountains, pressed
onward towards the Pacific slope, and, almost perishing
from hunger, were rescued by some trappers of
the Hudson Bay Company, who took them to their
post on the Columbia River. They spent the winter
in this place.</p>

<p>When spring approached, the pioneers again set out
for the Yellowstone. As they approached the Bear
River, an Indian runner came bounding down the trail.
He was of the Snake tribe and held up his right hand
in token of friendship.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>“I come from the people of the great chief, Pim,”
said he. “The Great Spirit has taken our beloved
ruler to the land of the hereafter. It is requested by
his people that our white brothers read over him their
medicine book (the Bible) and sing one of their songs.
Then lay our great chief to rest upon the banks of
the Bear River. Here he can ever hear the wonderful
music of the stream, and here his spirit can make the
beaver plenty for our white brothers.”</p>

<p>It was a strange request.</p>

<p>“Boys,” said Thomas Eddie, “we will do as our
red brother wishes. We will bury our good friend
Pim in a Christian manner, for he was always kindly
disposed to all the trappers and pioneers who came
in contact with him.”</p>

<p>Turning back upon their trail, the trappers travelled
forty miles to the camp of the Snakes. In relays of
four, they carried the dead chieftain slowly and tenderly
to the banks of the roaring Bear River, and
there laid him to rest, reading over him the burial
service and singing a hymn. A volley was fired over
the open grave, then, turning sadly towards the mountains,
the men in buckskin left the red men to perform
their own last rites over the dead chieftain.</p>

<p>As they neared the hills, the pugnacious Blackfeet
again began to harass them. Every day they
made an attack, but as they were principally armed
with arrows they did little damage. A few had rifles,
but they rarely used them. When the trappers had
been fighting with these fellows, the year before, numbers
of them had fallen beneath the steady aim of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
whites, but not a single trapper had been killed or
even dangerously wounded. This shows you what
poor marksmen the Indians were.</p>

<p>Not long afterwards the little band of adventurers
was passing through a narrow and lonely valley. As
they reached a passageway through high and precipitous
cliffs, a shot rang out, and a wild Indian yell told
them the Blackfeet were again on their trail.</p>

<p>“We’re ambushed, boys!” cried Eddie. “Take to
cover and ward off these skulkers, for from the sound
of their fire it is apparent that they have plenty of
guns and ammunition.”</p>

<p>He had scarcely spoken when he uttered a sharp
cry of pain, for a rifle ball struck him in the thigh
and penetrated well into his flesh. It was cut out by
a trapper called Will Sublette, with a beaver knife,
but our hero was in a serious condition for some time
thereafter. Fortunately the members of the party
were near water, so they threw up a rough barricade,
by means of digging with their hunting-knives, and
adding brush and tree trunks to the fortification. Several
were unable to proceed, five had been killed, and
twenty were severely wounded.</p>

<p>The Blackfeet could be easily seen as they circled
about, some on foot, some on their ponies. They
continuously yelped, howled like coyotes, and kept up
a fusillade against the earth and brush fortification.
Fortune favored the trappers, however, as there was
an abundance of beaver in the stream which ran
through the valley and these were easily captured.
Trout were also plentiful and the wanderers managed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
to put up a fortification behind which they could catch
the speckled beauties without molestation by the
painted and bloodthirsty Blackfeet. The wounded
made a rapid recovery, and in ten days were able to
travel.</p>

<p>“Now, boys,” said Eddie, at this time, “it is important
that we get away. Let us take our old clothes,
stuff them with grass in order to deceive the red men,
and light our camp-fires as usual. The Blackfeet will
see the dark bodies near the flames and will not suspect
that we have gotten away. We will move off
towards the North, but you must make no noise.”</p>

<p>The trappers were eager to be off. That night they
lighted their fires, placed the dummy figures so that
they could be readily seen, and crept away from their
little fortification. The Blackfeet did not suspect this
departure, and, although it was a hazardous march
over a rough path, allowed the men under Eddie to
get safely away. By forced marches, and travelling
over a crooked trail, the pioneers at length reached
the Yellowstone. But their troubles were not yet at
an end.</p>

<p>Trapper Eddie had left camp one day in order to
look for game, and was returning to the place where
the horses were tethered, when he saw a small band
of Crow Indians who were endeavoring to drive off
the stock. Firing at the leader of the expedition he
knocked him to the ground. One of the braves
jumped to the earth, lifted the dead chieftain upon
his horse, and rode off with him. Eddie’s comrades
heard the shooting and galloped to meet their leader.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>Eddie knew the valley well. It doubled almost upon
itself, making a horse-shoe curve, and he was aware
that should he ascend the mountain on the right he
would be able to head off the redskins.</p>

<p>“Boys!” cried he. “Follow me over that mountain.
We will meet the red men, recapture our
bronchos, and pay them well for their dastardly attempt
to run off our steeds.”</p>

<p>His men gave a cheer, and, putting spurs to their
horses, galloped up the steep slope of the mountain.
Sure enough, as they reached the top, there
were the redskins just below them. Uttering a
wild cowboy yell, the trappers dashed to the
assault.</p>

<p>A narrow pass in the mountains lay before them
and for this the Indians hastened, yelping fiercely as
they went. The trappers were as experienced men
at shooting on horseback as Buffalo Bill, and they
soon dropped most of the Crows as they vainly endeavored
to escape. The fellow who was carrying
the leader was badly wounded, and as he endeavored
to ride his heavily burdened horse across a stream,
which flowed through the valley, the animal stumbled
and fell, throwing both the live and the dead man
into the water. The trappers were close upon them
as they went down, but what became of the dead
chieftain and his attendant was never known. They
disappeared from view. Whether the live Crow was
killed by the fall, or was stunned and perished in the
swift current, is still a question. Perhaps he made
his way back to his own tribe. At any rate, a careful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
search failed to discover the whereabouts of either of
them.</p>

<p>“By George!” cried “Old Bill” Williams, who
was one of Eddie’s party, “I reckon that the dead
one has carried the live fellow to Heaven with him.”</p>

<p>The horses were soon retaken, and with smiles
of satisfaction upon their faces the trappers returned
to their camp on the Yellowstone. Here, seated
around the blazing camp-fire, they again fought over
their battles, compared notes of the country, made
rude maps of their routes, with the various rivers,
mountains, and plains; and those who had seen the
waters of the Great Salt Lake told their comrades of
this vast inland sea, whose waters were bitterly salt,
and into whose depths nothing could sink because of
the great buoyancy of the waves.</p>

<p>There was an abundance of game in the Yellowstone
country. The fourteen scouts spent the entire
season, and part of the next, in trapping for mink,
beaver, otter, and bear. They set their beaver traps
in all the suitable streams between the head of the
Missouri River and the upper waters of the Platte,
meeting with great success. Indians were plentiful,
but seemed to leave them alone, for they had undoubtedly
heard of the summary vengeance which the trappers
had taken upon the thieving Crows.</p>

<p>“Boys,” said Eddie, one day, “we are about all
through with our ammunition and I would like to
send seven of our number to Santa Fé, New Mexico,
in order to get a supply. Who will be willing to
undertake the trip?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>“I will,” came from the throats of many, and it
was plainly evident that there would be little difficulty
in getting volunteers for this hazardous duty.</p>

<p>Seven were chosen for the journey&mdash;seven of the
strongest and most hardy&mdash;but the seven were never
seen again. Cheerfully they set out across the sandy
plains of Colorado. When they were just about to
disappear from view, they turned and waved their
hands to those left behind.</p>

<p>“So long, boys,” cried one. “We will meet again
in a few months.”</p>

<p>But they never met again. From the time that they
disappeared upon the horizon all trace of them was
lost. Perhaps they fell before the arrows and bullets
of the Sioux, Kiowa, Apache, Comanche, Navajo, or
other red men. Perhaps the lounging and lazy Spanish
banditti captured them and carried them across
the Mexican line. At any rate, their fate is enveloped
in impenetrable mystery.</p>

<p>Eddie and his companions waited for many months
for some sign of their comrades. At length they gave
up hopes of their return, and leaving a note to direct
them where to go should they ever come back, made
their way to the Yellowstone. Hostile red men hovered
about them and endeavored to cut off their ponies,
but these were dispersed in several smart skirmishes.
Finally they reached a camp some forty miles above
Boulder, Colorado, where Eddie and Bill Gordon had
a rather serious encounter with some Arapahoes, when
returning from an antelope hunt.</p>

<p>“By gracious!” cried Bill, the trapper, as he saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
the redskins swooping down upon them. “I believe
that we are about to lose our scalps, Eddie. ‘<i>Never
say die</i>,’ must be our motto.”</p>

<p>“Let’s break for that canyon,” answered the lion-hearted
Eddie. “If we get into those rocks the yelping
redskins can shoot all they want to but they can’t
hurt us. We’ll crawl over there by the water so that
they cannot starve us out. We have food enough to
last us for some time.”</p>

<p>Crack! Crack! sounded the rifles of the red men,
and both Eddie and Gordon were struck. Nothing
daunted, they ran to the shelter of the ravine, where
they returned the fire with so much accuracy that
two of the redskins fell to the ground. The Indians
numbered about twelve, but only five were detached to
follow the two scouts, while the rest rode away, carrying
the two dead men with them. As they went in
the direction of the camp of the plainsmen Eddie
feared that they would surprise his comrades and
would annihilate them.</p>

<p>“Gordon,” said he, “you must remain here, while
I run back to camp and warn our companions of the
approach of these murderers. You have only five to
deal with, and I know that you can handle them.”</p>

<p>Eddie ran swiftly up the canyon, and then, back-tracking,
hid himself behind a huge boulder. The
redskins saw him and made after his retreating form
with great speed, but failed to see him in his hiding-place.
They were soon out of sight.</p>

<p>The scout darted down the canyon as rapidly as
possible and dashed out upon the open prairie as hard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
as he could go. Before him was an Arapaho who
was watching the Indian ponies. He was mounted
upon a buckskin pinto and was armed with a rifle,
tomahawk, and knife. As Eddie approached, he
raised his rifle. The scout did likewise and both fired
at about the same moment.</p>

<p>The trapper was struck in the shoulder, but the
injury was not severe, while his own ball passed
through the red man’s thigh, breaking the leg of the
horse upon which he was riding. This brought him
to the earth and pinned the warrior beneath him, but
the savage frantically struggled to escape, and, as
the white man approached, drew his knife. His tomahawk
had dropped some distance away as he fell.</p>

<p>Now was a thrilling encounter. Notwithstanding
the pain in his wound and his weakness from loss of
blood, the Indian made a desperate fight. He hoped,
no doubt, that the shots which both he and his antagonist
had fired would bring his companions to his
assistance. No such luck was in store for him. Eddie
was a small and wiry man, while the Arapaho was a
veritable giant in stature. The scout was armed with
a tomahawk and endeavored to get in a thrust, but
with ill success, for the redskin parried his every
attempt. Just as Eddie had succeeded in making a
sweeping blow, which, had it reached the red man,
would have cut him down, the savage caught his arm,
and the tomahawk flew from his grasp. The Indian’s
knife was in his left hand and the scout made a desperate
lunge in order to seize it.</p>

<p>It was a hazardous moment for Thomas Eddie.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
As he struggled for the possession of the coveted
knife he saw four Arapahoes emerge from the mouth
of the canyon and dash towards them. It was touch
and go with the famous man of the frontier. The
savage made a thrust at this moment. Eddie caught
the blade in his right hand, but the knife cut him
through and through, inflicting a desperate and gaping
wound. In spite of the pain it caused him, the trapper
held on. With his other hand he seized the Arapaho
by the throat and pushed him to the earth.</p>

<p>A new complication arose. A shot rang out from
the mouth of the canyon and the foremost Indian fell
to the ground. The other three halted and faced the
new enemy, while the big fellow with whom he was
struggling turned his head for a moment, in order to
see who was approaching. On the short moment hung
his life, for Eddie wrested the long knife from him,
and, as he looked around, buried the blade in his side.
The Arapaho fell to the ground, with a long, gasping
cry. The three savages, who were approaching, were
now about fifty yards away and they fired upon the
victorious scout, but did not hit him. Instead of this
they wounded another one of their horses.</p>

<p>Hurrah for Eddie! He had certainly done well,
and was in the same class with Adam Poe, who, if
you remember, had such a desperate battle with Big
Foot, the celebrated Shawnee warrior and athlete.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
The nervy fellow was not to be caught napping.
Dashing to the nearest pony, he set off at full speed
for the mouth of the canyon, circling as he did so,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>in order to avoid the three savages. To his surprise,
he met Bill Gordon, who told him that from the top
of a low mountain he had seen the Arapahoes engaged
in a battle with a band of Crows, way off upon the
plain, and that therefore he had returned to his assistance,
as he knew that their companions in camp would
not be molested.</p>

<p>“Well, let’s finish up these Arapahoes,” cried Eddie.
“And punish them for their interference with honest
men. Are you with me, Bill?”</p>

<p>Old Bill uttered a wild yell.</p>

<p>“Of course I’m with you, son,” said he. “Lay
on! Lay on!”</p>

<p>Spurring their mustangs, the two scouts dashed
madly after the fleeing redskins. They caught up
with them, and by excellent shooting succeeded in
killing them all. At once they returned to their own
camp with the arms and ponies of the savages, and,
upon narrating their adventures to the other scouts,
it was decided to move as rapidly as possible from
such a dangerous locality. Turning towards the turbid
waters of the Yellowstone, they soon reached this
wonderful stream, where no other bands of Indians
molested them. Their battles were over.</p>

<p>Upon their return to the settlement at Council
Bluffs all welcomed them uproariously, for many
thought that the nervy fellows had perished in the
wilderness. Their furs and peltries netted them a
snug figure; so snug, in fact, that plainsman Eddie
purchased a tavern of his own called the Green Tree.
Here he dispensed a lavish hospitality and here he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
brought his bride in 1833. She was a Miss Clarke,
a reigning belle of St. Louis, and, although the mother
of eleven sturdy children (five boys and six girls)
always remained a woman of remarkable beauty.
Many were the tales which the trapper used to tell
his children of his early experiences on the plains,
and, although the frost of old age gradually touched
his auburn hair with snow, the fire and imagination
of youth always kept the spirit of the old pioneer as
fresh as when, as a young man, he made that dangerous
trip to the wild region of the West as a member
of the Rocky Mountain Fur Company. Thus in peace
and comfort passed the declining years of the last of
the trappers of the Great Frontier.</p>

<h2>JIM BRIDGER:</h2>

<p class="pch">FOUNDER OF BRIDGER, WYOMING, AND
FAMOUS INDIAN FIGHTER</p>

<p class="drop-cap03">IN the lower corner of the mighty state of Wyoming
is a town named after one of the most
noted of the trappers of the West&mdash;Jim
Bridger&mdash;who not only fought Indians but also
traded and trapped in many an unexplored portion of
the once unknown regions near the Rocky Mountains.
Fort Bridger&mdash;a strong stockade near by&mdash;received
its name from this famous plainsman, who hailed
from Illinois, and who was not only of humble, but
also of somewhat unrespectable parentage. Young
Jim ran away, when quite young, in order to escape
the hard usage which was his lot at home. On the
border he soon made his mark, for he was not only
a great rifle shot but also a man of unusual strength
and agility.</p>

<p>One day the scout was in a block-house, with a
number of other frontiersmen who had recently been
attacked by a band of Blackfoot warriors. These
were encamped at no great distance, and a truce had
been declared whereby neither side should molest the
other. Jim Bridger wandered into the camp of the
red men, and walked down the main street, looking,
with an interested eye, at their tepees, their squaws,
and the little papooses.</p>

<p>“Ugh! Ugh!” grunted some young bucks. “Paleface
he look like pig. Ugh! Ugh! He no fight. He
run away.”</p>

<p>Bridger grew crimson, but said nothing.</p>

<p>“Paleface waddle like duck,” continued one of the
Blackfeet. “Paleface have nose like black dog.”</p>

<p>This was too much for the usually calm and collected
Jim Bridger. Spinning upon his heel he rushed
up to the nearest redskin, hit him a blow between the
eyes and sent him reeling to the ground. Immediately
the whole camp was in an uproar. The trapper was
surrounded by a yelling, screeching mob of savages&mdash;was
made a prisoner&mdash;and was carried, struggling,
to a lodge upon the outskirts of the village. Then the
Indians gathered in a dense throng in order to decide
upon the fate of their captive.</p>

<p>There was much discussion as to what was to be
done with the scout. Some were for a light punishment,
as the trappers in the block-house were numerous,
and their rifles were accurate shooters when held
by the steady hands of the frontiersmen. “No!
No!” shouted many others. “He should be carried
to the mountains and there tortured. He has struck
one of our braves. The paleface must suffer death!”</p>

<p>Three older chiefs listened to all of this wild talk
and then gave their decision.</p>

<p>“The Paleface shall suffer death and torture! Let
some of the young men go to his lodge and bring
him to us.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>With a wild whoop, a number of the youthful warriors
rushed to the tepee in which they had shoved
the trapper, stoutly bound with deer thongs. As they
threw open the flap which hung over the doorway
surprise and dismay marked their features, for the
bird had flown. All were chagrined and angered at
the loss of their quarry. Whooping savagely, they
dashed back to their companions, many of whom
favored an immediate attack upon the block-house;
but the counsel of the older chiefs prevailed.</p>

<p>“The paleface warriors have sticks which shoot
very straight,” said they. “We must go away, or
they may attack us.”</p>

<p>Packing up their goods, and loading their travois,
they fled to the mountains.</p>

<p>But how had the daring plainsman escaped? Hush!
It was a dusky-hued maiden who had set him free,
and love will always find a way.</p>

<p>Jim Bridger, in fact, had met a young Indian girl
in the village who had returned the sudden affection
of the young trapper with much interest. With sadness
and dismay she watched his capture, and, when
she saw him thrown into the lodge, at first she determined
to run to the block-house in order to notify his
comrades of his predicament. She knew that they
would then demand his release, but, fearing an attack
in which some of her relatives would be killed and
her lover would be doubtless assassinated, she decided
to say nothing to the trappers. Instead, she determined
to set him free by her own hand. While the
savages wrangled over what was to be his fate she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
determined to creep to his tent, cut the deer thongs,
and point out the way to freedom.</p>

<p>Two sentinels watched the lodge where Jim Bridger
lay, and, as the Indian maid approached, one of them
moved towards her. She stooped almost to the earth,
darted behind a neighboring tepee, and crept stealthily
towards the rear of the tent. As luck would have it,
there was no sentinel at this point, and she cut a long
slit in the buffalo-skin curtain. Bridger was lying
upon a robe endeavoring to snap his bonds, and as he
saw her uttered an exclamation of surprise. At this,
the girl clapped one hand over his mouth. With the
other she cut the raw-hide thongs, and beckoned to
him to follow her.</p>

<p>The scout wormed his way out of the side of the
tent, crept upon all fours to a safe distance, then rose
and faced the Indian maiden.</p>

<p>“Dearest,” said he, “you have saved my life, and
Jim Bridger never forgets the kindness of such a one
as you. You shall be my wife.”</p>

<p>The Blackfoot maiden blushed, and answered that
whether there was peace or war between her people
and his, she would meet him in a certain grove of
pine trees, at the base of a distant mountain peak,
after two full moons. She counselled him how to
avoid the sentinels, how to elude any pursuers by
darting through a certain canyon, and then, as he
pressed her to his heart, their lips met. A moment
more and she had torn herself away, and had vanished
down the steep cliffs upon which they had clambered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>The scout did not tell his comrades how he had
escaped, for he feared that they would laugh at him.
And as the days passed by his brother trappers noticed
that he was cutting notches in a stick in order to mark
the time elapsing before some important event. At
length the stick was almost filled with little triangular
marks, and Bridger, saddling his horse, led another by
a long lariat, and set off for a certain towering peak
in the mountains. His companions little guessed
what was his real destination. Five days elapsed before
they again laid eyes upon him, but all were startled
and much surprised to see him ride into the camp,
one brilliant morning, with a dusky, Indian maiden
by his side. A broad smile was upon his face, while
the bride looked radiantly happy. As they rode up,
the joyous trappers gave three times three for Mr.
and Mrs. Jim Bridger.</p>

<p>From now on the pioneer had an adventurous
career, and, although away from his home for months
at a time, was always devoted to his Blackfoot bride,
although he often had passages at arms with her
kinsmen. Not long after his marriage he was in the
Medicine Bow Mountains, with a party of trappers,
when they were surrounded by hundreds of the Blackfeet.
Crying to them to surrender, the savage warriors
circled about upon their ponies, screeching like
so many devils, for they were sure that they had the
white men cornered. It looked dark for the adventurous
trappers.</p>

<p>“We must fight desperately, men,” cried out the
gallant Jim. “And must make our way towards the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
mountains near the Yellowstone. There we can stand
these pesky varmints off from behind the boulders.
But now we must break through their circle. Are you
all ready? Then&mdash;come on.”</p>

<p>The trappers cheered as Bridger led a charge
against the wild riders of the plains, who scattered
before the resolute attack. By alternately fighting
and retreating, the frontiersmen gradually made their
way towards the distant hills, and&mdash;although a few
were badly wounded&mdash;at length they reached the
protection of some giant boulders which afforded
them excellent protection against the bullets and arrows
of the red men. Seeing that it was now impossible
to get them, the savages fired a parting volley
and retired. The last shot proved to be an unlucky
one for Jim Bridger’s best friend&mdash;a man named
Milton Sublette&mdash;as a ball from an Indian rifle struck
him in the ankle and tore through both flesh and bone.</p>

<p>Stanching the flow of blood as best they could, the
trappers carried their wounded companion away with
them upon a Mackinaw blanket, slung between two of
the pack-animals. His leg was amputated with the aid
of a beaver knife hacked into a saw, and in spite of
the fact that they possessed no chloroform, ether, or
other anesthetic, the patient bore everything with stoical
indifference. His life was saved, and&mdash;strange
as it may seem&mdash;upon his arrival at Saint Louis he
submitted to a second operation in order to obtain a
better-looking stump, and was back again in his old
haunts within six months: trapping, fishing, and
travelling with as much joy in living as before. Such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
was the spirit and energy of these old men of the
mountains.</p>

<p>Bridger was later engaged in piloting emigrant
trains across the prairie, in the vicinity of the Republican
River, where Sandy Forsyth had his great battle
with Roman Nose some years later. With him was
a scout called Jim Beckwith, who has left the following
account of a tight, little brush which was indulged
in by two bands of Sioux and Pawnee warriors, just
after the trappers had driven away a force of about
fifty Pawnees who had attempted to run off their
horses.</p>

<p>“I seen that the Pawnees would soon be after us
again,” said the gallant Beckwith, “and I knowed that
the Sioux would do the same thing. So I saw that
we’d have about a thousand redskins after us, and
we wouldn’t be a taste for them. I seen that this
wouldn’t do, so I says to Jim Bridger, says I, ‘Jim,
what are we goin’ ter do?’ ‘Give it up,’ said Jim,
says he, ‘Fight till the reds down us, I reckon, and
then turn up our toes like men.’ All this time&mdash;bless
your soul&mdash;them pilgrims what we wuz a-guidin’,
wuz in the wagons cryin’. It wuz awful.</p>

<p>“Wall, I jest made up my mind, sir, that I didn’t
intend tew give my heart tew no Injun jest then, so
I callates about whar th’ two parties of red devils
would meet. When we got thar, we drove over a
raise in th’ plain and jes’ waited fur ’em. In about
two hours I seen th’ dust raisin’ in th’ East in er gret,
big cloud. ‘Them’s Pawnees,’ says I, ‘by th’ tarnal
prophet.’ Then I looked intew th’ West, and thar th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>’
dust wuz raisin’, too. ‘Them’s Sioux,’ says I, ‘an’ th’
Devil take ’em. I hev seen pleasanter sights.’ Wall,
after waitin’ some time th’ Injuns seen each other, an’
of all th’ cussed yellin’ you ever heard, it wuz thar.
I jes’ laid back an’ laughed, while Bridger done some
tall chucklin’ too, when them two bands got together.
It was lively times, yew bet.</p>

<p>“Th’ Injuns didn’t have many guns in them days,
but you kin jest rest assured that they used their arrers
fur what wuz in ’em. Thar they went circlin’
aroun’ each other, bendin’ under their hosses’ necks,
an’ lettin’ th’ arrers fly. At one time th’ air wuz near
so full uv arrers thet it made a cloud, shettin’ out th’
sun. Their ponies got stuck full uv ’em. Their dogs
wuz full uv ’em, an’ every Injun in th’ gang had er
lot uv ’em stickin’ inter him. I seed a big, fat feller
ridin’ off with two uv ’em stickin’ into th’ seat uv his
buckskins, an’ it reminded me so uv er big pincushion,
thet I near died uv laughin’. Then they begun tew
run. They run this way, an’ they run that, and&mdash;by
Gravy&mdash;I believe thet some uv them Injuns be still
runnin’ from one another. By Gum, they wuz so busy
fightin’ each other, thet they left us plum alone.”</p>

<p>This was certainly a laughable incident, but a bit
later occurred another episode which was not quite
so amusing for the daring and adventurous Jim
Bridger.</p>

<p>About six months after the fight upon the Republican,
with five companions, the trapper was travelling
near the Platte River. The plainsmen were in search
of buffalo and had seen a fair sized herd when a band<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
of Sioux Indians appeared upon one of the rolling
bluffs. The trappers sought cover, for they expected
an attack, and they were not far from being wrong,
for the red men immediately made after them; circled
about them upon their ponies, and fired their rifles at
long range.</p>

<p>“Dig a trench with your knives,” shouted Bridger.
“These fellows are out for our blood and they are
going to come pretty near getting us. Move over
near that water hole so that they can’t make us die
of thirst, and we’ll see who can last the longest.”</p>

<p>Scrambling to their knees, the plainsmen quickly
threw up a barricade near the water hole, and, hobbling
their ponies behind them, began to take careful
aim at the Sioux&mdash;one of whom was soon sent to the
Happy Hunting Grounds. This enraged the remainder,
and wild, blood-curdling yells echoed across the
prairie as they drew nearer, hoping to make a rush
and annihilate the five white trappers.</p>

<p>“Get ready, boys!” again shouted Bridger.
“They’re going to rush us!”</p>

<p>All prepared for the advance by laying out additional
ammunition and placing long hunting-knives
near at hand. In a few moments the Sioux came on,
whipping their ponies to their utmost speed, and
yelping madly.</p>

<p>A ringing volley knocked over four of the leaders,
but still on they came. Another shot sent a fifth
chieftain to the Great Beyond, and, as the trappers
reloaded, the Sioux seemed to lose heart. They
swerved aside from the breastwork, offering excellent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
targets to the plainsmen, and, with a dull thud, still
another red warrior fell from his galloping pinto.
Two of the trappers, meanwhile, were wounded by
bullets, while an arrow stuck into the coat sleeve of
Jim Bridger, himself.</p>

<p>Now retiring beyond range, the redskins kept up
a perpetual fusillade with rifles and with arrows. The
trappers held their fire, threw up still higher entrenchments,
and waited for the next onslaught, but this did
not come. Instead, the Sioux lighted the long, dry
prairie grass, and a sheet of flame and smoke curled
surely and steadily towards the band of plainsmen, for
the wind was blowing directly upon them. What were
they to do now?</p>

<p>Necessity is the mother of invention. Quick as a
flash, Jim Bridger leaped across the embankment,
touched the grass off immediately in front of them,
and burnt off quite a small alley-way before the roaring
crackling flames came to their place of refuge.
The force of the flames thus spent itself before the
embankment was reached, and the wily savages renewed
their whooping and yelling. Again they
charged, but again they were driven off; while night
closed over both besieger and besieged, bringing a lull
to the unequal battle.</p>

<p>Next day the fight was renewed, and all five of the
trappers were wounded. Towards evening it was decided
that one of the party should creep through the
lines and bring aid from a camp of fifty trappers, who
were some miles down the river. The choice fell upon
Jim Bridger, and it found him ready to undertake<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
the hazardous expedition. At twelve o’clock he
crawled over the side of the little fortification and
wormed his way towards the fringe of red warriors
who lay about them in a circle.</p>

<p>The scout kept on as quietly as he could and crawled
for fully two hundred yards before he saw, or heard,
anything of the redskins. Then he got to his feet (as
he considered himself through their lines) and prepared
to run. But before him was an Indian pony,
its master sound asleep by its side. The horse had
been feeding in a deep ravine, and&mdash;suddenly scenting
the trapper&mdash;gave a snort which roused its
master. The Sioux warrior gazed stupidly at the
frontiersman.</p>

<p>But Bridger did not take long to make up his mind
what to do. He dashed towards the Indian, intending
to strangle him before he could give the alarm. The
redskin uttered a loud whoop, and his companions
immediately ran in his direction. The scout realized
that nothing was now to be gained by silence, and,
pulling out his pistol, shot the red man dead. Then,
leaping upon his mustang, he urged him upon the gallop.
The Sioux were all around him on their pintos,
but he had the good fortune to be upon one of their
fastest horses, which seemed to outdistance any of
the pursuers.</p>

<p>It was a hot chase. The red men fired again and
again at the fleeing trapper but they could not hit him.
His mustang leaped over the deep crevasses, dodged
badger and prairie-dog holes, and brought him safely
to the camp of his companions by two o’clock in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
afternoon. The Sioux had given up the chase, and,
little suspecting that other trappers were camped near
by, had returned to the siege of the four, hoping
now to make one sudden rush and gain their scalps.
Their blood was up, for twenty-five of their number
had fallen before the accurate fire of the besieged.</p>

<p>“Come at once!” cried the panting Bridger, as he
reached the camp of the plainsmen. “If you do not
hurry, my four companions will all be massacred by
the red men. To horse! To horse!”</p>

<p>It did not take the trappers long to catch their
ponies and jump into their saddles.</p>

<p>“Show us where your friends are!” cried they,
“and we’ll fix th’ redskins before another sun.”</p>

<p>Bridger turned and piloted the band of plainsmen
back to the place where he had left his beleaguered
companions. They went on the run, but, making a
wide détour in order to gain the sand-hills in the rear
of the besiegers, waited until morning. Then they
heard rifle shots in the distance and knew that the
battle was on again.</p>

<p>Creeping towards the sound of firing, they soon saw
the Sioux preparing for a final charge upon the valorous
four, and opened upon them. They had clustered
together for a rush, and this weltering volley fairly
took the heart out of those of small courage. Many
fell dead,&mdash;the rest made all haste to get out of
range,&mdash;while the four trappers in the embankment
came running towards their deliverers like wild men.
With yells of joy they hugged the burly form of Jim<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
Bridger, to whose nerve and courage they owed their
lives.</p>

<p>The scout and plainsman soon moved from the
upper waters of the Missouri&mdash;after the fur trade
had ceased to be prosperous&mdash;and founded a trading
post in the southwestern part of the State of Wyoming&mdash;named
Fort Bridger. Here he dealt in skins,
furs, and peltries, accumulating a large amount of
property, as the Fort was a stopping-place for all the
emigrant trains bound for Salt Lake City and for
California. He remained true to his Blackfoot wife,
and several half-breed children made life merry in the
long, low log-hut which the scout had erected as his
abode. The famous plainsman lived to a ripe, old age&mdash;like
most of the early trappers&mdash;and was ever
ready to tell of his battle with the Sioux, when he
rescued his four companions from their clutches. This
was the most thrilling of all his many adventures upon
the frontier.</p>

<div class="break">

<h2 class="p4">“OLD BILL” WILLIAMS:</h2>

<p class="pch">THE FAMOUS LOG RIDER OF COLORADO</p>

<p class="drop-cap">“I HATE every Indian that I ever saw and would
just as lief take a shot at one as eat!”</p>

<p class="pn">So spoke a raw-boned trapper, with a tangled
mat of brown hair hanging across his shoulders,
and, as he said this, he gazed vindictively toward
some Indian warriors who were riding slowly past the
wagon-train with which the plainsman was travelling.
His comrades looked at him and laughed, for this was
the favorite theme of Bill Williams, familiarly known
as “Old Bill,” although this was a term of endearment
and not because of his years, for he was as young
as any of them.</p>

<p>The Indians rode on, and from their own glances,
which they threw at the gaunt and ungainly trapper,
it was plainly evident that they fully reciprocated the
feeling which the plainsman held for them. “Ugh!
He one bad man!” a gaudy warrior was heard to
remark.</p>

<p>“Old Bill” Williams was born in Tennessee, his
father being one of the Virginian pioneers who crossed
the Blue Ridge and settled in the state when it was
swarming with Indians,&mdash;all eager to have the land
for themselves alone&mdash;and not willing to allow the
whites to get possession of it without a severe struggle.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
His son grew up in surroundings of savagery
and warfare. He took part in many of the Ohio campaigns
against the red men in that state, and was invariably
used as a scout, for his knowledge of woodcraft
was excellent. After the red men were partially
subdued, he moved further west to the Rockies, where
his scouting habits still clung to him. He would often
be absent for many weeks upon his solitary expeditions,
and would as frequently return with scalps as
with the furs of wild animals.</p>

<p>The Crows and the Blackfeet were continually at
war with each other, with the advantage upon the side
of the latter, for the Crows were more cowardly than
their war-like enemies. They had the advantage, however,
of having a white renegade to lead them. His
name was Rose: formerly one of the land pirates who
lived near and upon the treacherous waters of the
Mississippi. This desperate man taught the redskins
how to fight like the whites and continually advised
them in their councils of war, so that they often defeated
the Blackfeet in their sanguinary encounters.</p>

<p>One day “Old Bill” Williams was off on a scout
with Bill Gordon, and, becoming separated from him,
was endeavoring to reach camp by water, so as to
leave no trail for the eye of some lurking Blackfoot
warrior. He was therefore floating down stream on
a log. As he reached a shallow part of the creek the
muddied water and footprints upon the bank showed
where a big grizzly had just gone by.</p>

<p>“By Gravy,” said the scout to himself, “here’s the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
chance to make a hundred dollars from that old fellow’s
hide. I’m after him.”</p>

<p>Wading to the shore, he started off through the
brush, and followed Bruin with his head down, for
the bushes kept slapping him in the eyes. As he was
thus proceeding, he suddenly debouched from the
brush into a cleared space. Before him was no
grizzly, but a band of ten Blackfoot warriors. They
stopped in amazement, and so did Williams, who said
in loud tones: “Gee-hos-i-phat!”</p>

<p>The Indians, on the other hand, set up a loud
yelping, and, seeing them preparing to fire, “Old Bill”
raised his trusty flint-lock, pulled the trigger, and
knocked over a big, fine-looking savage who had on
the war-bonnet of a chieftain. Not stopping to make
closer acquaintance, the wiry Bill then dashed into a
neighboring canyon. As he glanced over his shoulder
he saw that only four of the Blackfeet were coming
after him.</p>

<p>The scout raced along for about a quarter of a
mile; then, seeing that the redskins were far behind,
stopped in order to load his rifle. He had just rammed
home a ball when the Blackfeet began to draw near,
so he dropped behind the stump of a moss-grown tree
and waited for them to come on. They approached
quite hurriedly, gazing at the ground for tracks, and
eagerly pointing out the traces of the trapper’s footprints.
When they came within good range “Old
Bill” pressed the trigger and a Blackfoot brave fell to
the earth, shot through the heart.</p>

<p>“I reckon that this will stop ’em fer er minute er<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
two,” said the man of the plains as he continued his
flight up the canyon. He raced ahead for about a half
a mile, then halted again in order to load his gun.</p>

<p>The Indians were soon upon him, but they had
learned caution, and spread out on either side of him,
in order to get in his rear. “Old Bill” was not to be
caught napping, and ran like a deer still further up
the divide. He was much swifter of foot than the
red men, and soon left them far behind. The scout
sat down upon a fallen tree trunk, and said to himself:</p>

<p>“Now, I’ll back track like a grizzly, and will get
another shot at these painted hyenas.”</p>

<p>Suiting the action to the words, he put on a furious
burst of speed for about a half a mile, then doubled
back for about two hundred yards. To the right was
some fallen timber, and into this the trapper skipped
like a molly cotton-tail. “Ah ha!” said he. “I
think this will get ’em!”</p>

<p>In a few moments the red warriors hastened by on
the run: one of them about a hundred yards astern
of the rest. As he came opposite the hiding-place of
the scout, “Old Bill” leaped into view, and knocking
him down with a well directed bullet, seized his victim’s
gun just as another started to come back to
where he was standing. This one was dispatched by
the Blackfoot rifle, and “Old Bill” had the satisfaction
of seeing the fourth (and last) savage run up
the canyon in terror, screaming:</p>

<p>“The Great Spirit is with him! The Great Spirit
is with him!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>As he disappeared a broad smile came to the face
of the trapper, while he wiped the beads of perspiration
from his brow.</p>

<p>“By Crickets!” said he. “A tight squeeze, Bill.
A tight squeeze!”</p>

<p>I regret to state that the old fellow <i>scalped</i> the dead
redskins, for he was apparently as much of an Indian
as were his enemies. He also took the precaution to
plunge into a mountain stream which gurgled and
rushed down a side of the canyon. He followed
the water until he reached the mouth of the canyon,
then, as he heard voices, dashed into a crevasse
in the rocks. A number of Blackfeet soon went
by.</p>

<p>“Where has the old wolf gone?” he heard one of
them ask. “He runs like a rabbit.”</p>

<p>“You are right,” said another, “but he has an
eye like a hawk, and can hold the shooting-stick without
flinching. Go carefully! Go carefully! He may
be hidden near by!”</p>

<p>They went on up the canyon, and not long afterwards
a wailing and screeching came from their direction,
showing that they had discovered their dead.</p>

<p>“This is no place for me,” mused the old scout.
“I must get away quickly.”</p>

<p>Darting up a neighboring gully, he had just stowed
himself away in a fissure of the rocky wall when he
heard the Blackfeet returning. They were carrying
their dead companions and were wailing dismally.
“Old Bill” knew that there would be small chance
for him should he fall into their clutches. The cold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
shivers ran up and down his spine as he contemplated
such a happening.</p>

<p>For two days the trapper remained in the canyon.
He was afraid to venture forth, because the Blackfeet
were undoubtedly near by, and he knew that, once
they again saw him, it would be all up with “Old
Bill.” He had a tough, dried piece of buffalo meat
with him, which kept up his strength, although he
suffered terribly from thirst during the day, for he
was afraid to venture to the stream until nightfall.
Far off, in the valley, he could hear the death chant
of the red men.</p>

<p>Three days passed and “Old Bill” was feeling faint
from lack of food. Climbing the wall of the canyon,
behind his place of refuge, he saw the Blackfeet far
below him in the valley. They were moving camp.
Hurrah! Their tepee poles were coming down and
they were walking away. They gradually faded from
view. Again Hurrah! The old scout was smiling
now.</p>

<p>Luck was still with him, for he shot an antelope
soon afterwards, cooked the stringy meat and felt
stronger. Then he rolled a stout log loose from some
fallen timber, pushed it into the river and paddled
down stream upon this flimsy boat.</p>

<p>“I reckon I’ll dodge the redskins, now,” he said
to himself. “A feller walkin’ leaves too good er
trail.”</p>

<p>No savage eye detected him in his journey upon
this log, and, about a week later, he arrived, smiling,
at a frontier trading post. “Old Bill” was royally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
welcomed by his brother trappers, who slapped him
on the back, drank his health, not once, but twenty
times, and gave him a new rifle which they had just
captured from some half-breeds.</p>

<p>“Old Bill” took this with good humor, for it was
all in the day’s work of a scout upon the frontier. In a
week he left upon another excursion into the wilds,
and alone, for he was like a “solitary,” or buffalo
bull, who roams the prairie away from the rest of
the herd. He preferred to be without associates
in his work. “Two men,” said he, “leave a
broader trail than one, and there are many Indians
in the country. Two men make more noise. I go
alone.”</p>

<p>“He was a great hunter,” said an old Indian. “He
was a great trapper&mdash;took many beaver&mdash;and a
great warrior, for his belt was full of scalps. But he
have no friend: no squaw. Always by himself. He
like the eagle in the heavens, or the panther in the
mountains. He one strange man.”</p>

<p>Yes, “Old Bill” was a strange man, but he lived
his life upon the frontier for many years without a
mishap, although his body bore the marks of many
an encounter. Silent and taciturn, those who were
associated with him knew only of his deeds by the
fresh scalps at his girdle, the notches upon the stock
of his gun, and the scars upon the exposed portion
of his body. His traps yielded him a small living,
and with this he seemed to be content.</p>

<p>The trapper lived to be an old man. Although in
innumerable skirmishes and hand-to-hand encounters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
with the Blackfeet, Crows, Sioux, and other wild
riders of the plains, he came off scot free until he
met a band of Blackfeet when trapping near the headwaters
of the Missouri River. Here he was surrounded
by twenty or thirty braves, but, by skillfully
climbing his pony down the shelving sides of a canyon,
made his escape. They found his tracks, however,
and followed him like a pack of hounds after
a fox.</p>

<p>“Old Bill” still was lithe and active, although
sixty years, and more, of age. Again and again he
hid himself, and, with two or three shots, laid out
as many of the advancing redskins. He was fortunate
in being able to keep away from the vindictive
warriors for four full days, although wounded twice:
an arrow point in his thigh and a bullet through the
fleshy part of his leg. Finally, he reached a series of
canyons near the Yellowstone, where numerous
streams made it possible for him to leave little
trace of his trail, and great boulders of rock hid
his retreating form. The red men here gave up
the chase, for their quarry defied both fatigue and
wounds.</p>

<p>“The Great Spirit is still with the Lone Wolf,”
said they. “We will let him go, for here he can kill
many of us before we can reach him.”</p>

<p>It was November. A bleak wind blew gusts of
snow across the sandy plain as the red warriors retreated.
“Old Bill” continued on his way into the
advancing storm. The white flakes now covered the
earth. A bitter wind assailed him, and great piles of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
drifting snow whirled and eddied about his gaunt and
emaciated form. Dismounting under the side of a
projecting cliff, he made a fire by means of rubbing
two dried sticks together, ate some <i>biltong</i>, which he
fortunately had stowed away in a saddle-bag, and lay
down to rest. His poor, shivering pony cropped the
dry bunches of grass in silent misery.</p>

<p>Two weeks later a party of trappers were crossing
the stream near the place where the old fellow had
lain down, and saw a pony nibbling the bark from a
cottonwood tree. He was gaunt, famished, and his
ribs were fairly sticking through his flesh. They
rode up to him and were much distressed to see the
form of a man lying beneath the white mantle of
newly fallen snow. They brushed this away and
found “Old Bill;” his grizzled head bent forward
upon his breast, and his clothing stained with the
wounds which had sapped his very life-blood. He
had gone to the Great Beyond.</p>

<p>With tears in their eyes the trappers hollowed out
a grave for the lone refugee. Here they buried him,
and finding his faithful steed unwilling to leave the
place where he had carried his master, shot the emaciated
animal. They placed both in the same grave,
and over their forms erected a huge pile of stones,
not only to mark the last resting-place of “Old Bill,”
but also to keep the wolves and coyotes from digging
up the remains.</p>

<p>Thus, in a wild canyon perished the aged solitary,
and in the peace and quiet of that wilderness in which
he loved to wander, hovers the spirit of the lonely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
man of the plains. His last resting-place well suited
the career of “Old Bill:” trapper, scout, and fearless
adventurer among the savage men, wild beasts, and
inhospitable wastes of the then unpeopled West.</p>

<h2>“BIG FOOT” WALLACE:</h2>

<p class="pch">NOTED RANGER ON THE TEXAN
FRONTIER</p>

<p class="drop-cap13">ABOUT the year 1839, a Waco Indian chieftain
lived in the State of Texas, whose feet were
of such giant proportions that he was called
“Big Foot.” He was a bold and daring fellow.
Often, when darkness hid his movement, he would
sneak into the frontier town of Austin, would kill
whom he could, and would carry off horses and other
property. In vain the settlers tried to dispatch him,
for he was a veritable scourge to the settlements.</p>

<p>The fellow was a physical giant, being six feet seven
inches in height, of muscular build, and weighing
about three hundred pounds. His tracks measured
fourteen inches, from heel to toe, so you can readily
see that the name that was applied to him was not ill
chosen. Often these footprints would be seen in the
sandy soil, after he had committed one of his thieving
expeditions, and the settlers used to cry out:</p>

<p>“Good-by to our horses! Old ‘Big Foot’ is
around again. Good-by!”</p>

<p>One evening the big Indian came into Austin, and,
after prowling around for a time, committed some
theft upon the property of a settler named Gravis.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
He then went to the cabin occupied by a huge, lanky
ranger called Wallace. Next morning Gravis trailed
the Indian to the doorstep of the pioneer, and, without
trying to trace it any further, aroused the owner
of the cabin.</p>

<p>“See here, Wallace,” said he, “you’ve been stealing
from my place and I intend to get even with you.
No one has as big feet as you have around here, and
I have found your tracks leading from my hut to
your very door.”</p>

<p>The accused man grew angry and prepared to whip
the other.</p>

<p>“Look here,” said Gravis, at this juncture, “if you
prove to me that these are not your footprints you
can go clear and I will apologize.”</p>

<p>He stepped aside, as he spoke, and Wallace immediately
went to the Indian’s track. He placed his foot
in it, exclaiming:</p>

<p>“By Gravy, Gravis, this is old ‘Big Foot,’ the
Injin’s, track. Can’t you see that it’s mor’n two
inches longer than my own!”</p>

<p>The first speaker bent over the marks with an exclamation
of astonishment.</p>

<p>“You’re right,” said he. “Wallace, old man, I
beg your pardon.” And, shaking him warmly by the
hand, he walked away.</p>

<p>While this was going on, a man named Fox came
to the doorway of Wallace’s hut. He had been spending
the night there, for he was a business partner of
the frontiersman. As his friend turned towards the
cabin, he cried out gleefully:</p>

<p class="vh"><a name="i261" id="i261">i261</a></p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-261.jpg" width="350" height="668"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pc">“BIG FOOT” WALLACE.</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, well, old scout. When ‘Big Foot’&mdash;the
Indian&mdash;is not around we will all call <i>you</i> ‘Big
Foot.’ Ha! Ha! That’s a good one, I swan. ‘Big
Foot’ you’ll be from henceforth.”</p>

<p>And that is the way that William Alexander Anderson
Wallace came to be called “Big Foot” Wallace.</p>

<p>Born in Lexington, Virginia, in 1817, this intrepid
frontiersman came of good, old Scottish stock, and
stock that was of fighting spirit, for two of his uncles
were killed in the battle of Guilford Court House.
The Wallaces were all of powerful build, and the hero
of our sketch was six feet two inches in height (in
his moccasins) and weighed two hundred and forty
pounds. He had long arms, large hands, and thick,
curly, black hair. One of his uncles was nearly seven
feet tall and his brother was six feet five inches in
height.</p>

<p>As a young fellow, “Big Foot” Wallace had little
of the excitement which was to come to him in later
years. When about twenty years of age war commenced
between the American colonists and Mexicans
for the possession of Texas. Many young men went
from Virginia to assist the Texans in driving out the
soldiers under Santa Anna, among them Samuel
Wallace, the older brother of William with the big
feet. Samuel was killed in the massacre of Colonel
Fannin’s men at Goliad, which has been described in
“Famous Scouts,” and with him were also dispatched
three cousins of our hero. When the news of this
affair reached Lexington, Virginia, great was the grief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
among the relatives of these brave and valiant frontiersmen,
and William was much upset by it.</p>

<p>“I am going to Texas,” he cried out. “And I
intend to spend my life in killing Mexicans. Those
men who could massacre my brother after he had surrendered
and had been disarmed, can expect no quarter
from me. I intend to have revenge!”</p>

<p>He had splendid opportunities in later years to make
good this threat.</p>

<p>Taking ship from New Orleans to Galveston, William
soon set foot on Texan soil. The war was over.
Santa Anna had been defeated and captured the year
before, at the famous battle of San Jacinto, and Texas
was now an independent republic. So the young
ranger drifted to Colorado, where he was soon surrounded
by a large party of Indians and was captured.
They carried him to their camp, but he only remained
there a week, before he slipped away, eluded his pursuers,
and got back to the settlement of San Antonio.
His restless spirit could not be confined to the streets
of a city and he soon went far to the southwest, where
he camped and hunted along the Medina River.
Finally he built a cabin there and lived the life of a
lone huntsman and trapper in a region which was
infested by Indians, horse-thieves, and fugitives from
justice.</p>

<p>“Big Foot” Wallace had not been long in the
country before he realized that something had to be
done in order to keep law and order in this unsettled
land. Besides the numerous raids of hostile bands of
Indians&mdash;who roamed at will from New Mexico to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
the coast region of Texas&mdash;desperadoes and gamblers
swarmed around all the border towns, and more particularly
around San Antonio. No one was safe who
opposed these wild fellows, and it was almost impossible
to keep horses. The thieves would even dig
through the adobe walls of the stables in order to steal
them. A strong hand was needed to awe these desperate
men and keep the Indians in check. There was
one man in western Texas at this time who was quite
equal to the emergency. His name was “Captain”
Jack Hays.</p>

<p>The Governor of Texas sent for him.</p>

<p>“I hereby commission you to raise a company of
Rangers,” said he to the gallant Captain Jack. “You
will make San Antonio your headquarters and you
must hold both Indians and horse-thieves in check.
You can follow the redskins anywhere that you wish,
and, if necessary, you can shoot any horse-thief upon
the spot.”</p>

<p>“Big Foot” Wallace soon heard of the Rangers,
and applied for admission at once. He was accepted,
for he was strong, fearless, a good rider, and an excellent
shot. Captain Hays was very particular as
to the kind of men that he enlisted, and that is why
he had the best set of Indian fighters that Texas ever
produced. Each man had to have a good horse, valued
at one hundred dollars, and also a rifle of the best
make. The desperadoes and horse-thieves soon began
to disappear from the neighborhood of San Antonio.</p>

<p>In the numerous affrays which now took place “Big
Foot” Wallace had a prominent part. Several battles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
were fought with the Indians. In 1842 the Mexicans
made a sudden descent from Mexico and captured San
Antonio. At the quarters used by the Texan Rangers
they found a pair of pantaloons belonging to “Big
Foot” Wallace, and this they appropriated as their
own.</p>

<p>“By the eternal prophet,” shouted the scout, when
he heard of the theft. “I will sure get even with the
Greasers for this, and I will kill a Señor and get another
pair of breeches, or bust.”</p>

<p>Not long afterwards Jack Hays and his men rode
near the town and gave the Mexicans such “a dare”
that their whole force of cavalry and infantry came
out to chase them. There were four hundred Mexicans
and but a small squad of Rangers, yet the Texans
kept up a stiff firing and retreated slowly across
the plains. During the battle, “Big Foot” Wallace
was continually upon the lookout to kill a big Mexican
and get another pair of trousers to replace his own.
He had not long to wait.</p>

<p>The Mexicans soon charged, and in the mix-up
that ensued one daring fellow approached Wallace,
and pointing his carbine at him, cried out: “Take
that, you accursed cow-thief!” Whereupon he discharged
his piece in his face. The large ounce ball
from the clumsy musket just grazed the nose of the
scout and nearly blinded him with smoke. “Big
Foot” fired his own piece, but missed. As this occurred,
another Ranger cried out: “My, my, what
awful bad shooting,” and&mdash;aiming his rifle&mdash;quickly
sent a ball through the Mexican’s body. The man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
from the south of the Rio Grande fell against a
mesquite tree and soon died.</p>

<p>“Big Foot” breathed more easily, and during the
next charge heard one of his companions call out:</p>

<p>“’Big Foot,’ yonder is a Mexican who has on a
pair of pants large enough to fit you. Go get ’em,
boy! Go get ’em!”</p>

<p>The Mexican in question was assisting some of
the wounded back to the rear. Wallace kept his eye
on him and said:</p>

<p>“If I can get him, I will. But th’ critter moves
about so fast that I can’t draw a bead on him.”</p>

<p>As he spoke, he attracted the attention of General
Caldwell, who commanded some infantrymen who
had come to the assistance of the Rangers. The dress
of the giant Texan, his massive frame, and his actions,
were sufficient to mark him as a man born to leadership.</p>

<p>“What command do you hold, sir?” inquired Caldwell,
as he rode up to the fighting Ranger.</p>

<p>“None,” answered “Big Foot,” saluting. “I am
one of Jack Hays’ Rangers and I want that fellow’s
breeches over there, as the Greasers have stolen mine
from me.” He pointed, as he spoke, to his intended
victim.</p>

<p>The general laughed and rode on, determined to
advance “Big Foot” to a Lieutenancy, if the opportunity
presented itself. The Ranger, meanwhile, crept
nearer to the fellow with the big pantaloons, and before
many moments laid him low by a well directed
shot. Making a dash for the fallen man, he seized<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
him by the shoulders, dragged him into the American
lines, and soon was wearing a new pair of yellow
trousers.</p>

<p>“Hurrah for ‘Big Foot,’” shouted his companions.
“He has, at last, made good his threat of vengeance.
Hurrah for ‘Big Foot!’”</p>

<p>The Mexicans were defeated, driven from San Antonio,
and were followed by Captain Jack Hays and
his Rangers as far as the Hondo River, where the
rear guard was attacked by a detachment under “Big
Foot,” and some cannon were captured. The mule
which the leader was riding was slightly wounded,
but this was the only mishap to the Americans. The
Mexicans withdrew in safety to their own territory.</p>

<p>The blood of the Texans was now up. “Revenge
for the taking of San Antonio!” was heard on every
side. “Vengeance upon the Mexicans! Revenge!”</p>

<p>Thus, in retaliation for the invasion of Texas under
Wall, an expedition started for Mexico in 1843, commanded
by General Somervell. Captain Jack Hays
was there with his Rangers, but the expedition went
to pieces on the Rio Grande and most of the men came
back, among them Captain Jack and many of his followers.
Five captains, however, determined to go on,
in the invasion of Mexico,&mdash;that is, if they could
get men enough. Three hundred Texans immediately
decided to fight: among this number, “Big Foot”
Wallace and several other Rangers. Electing a certain
Captain Fisher to the chief command, they crossed
the Rio Grande and encamped opposite the town of
Mier. Its streets were soon to run red with blood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>The chief man of a Mexican town is called an alcade,
and, on the following morning, the Americans
marched into the town and told the alcade that he
must furnish them with provisions and with clothing.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, Señors,” said the Mexican official, bowing.
“To-morrow the articles will be delivered to
you, two miles below your camp.”</p>

<p>But the Texans did not believe in taking any
chances. They brought the alcade along with them
when they went back to their camp, so as to be sure
that the provisions would really be delivered. They
waited two full days and no goods were to be seen.
They grew anxious and soon their spies made them
more so, for these reported that General Ampudia had
arrived in Mier with a large force of Mexican troops.</p>

<p>“We will proceed to the town and give them battle!”
cried out the Texan commander.</p>

<p>By four o’clock in the afternoon the Americans had
all crossed and were on their way to the little Mexican
post. The spies were in front and first met the Mexicans
as they sallied out from Mier. But the Rangers
knew how to shoot and Ampudia retreated before the
Texan bullets. At dark the Mexicans again entered
their stronghold and barricaded themselves.</p>

<p>The Texans had their fighting blood up, and, in
spite of the darkness, advanced to Alcantra Creek, east
of the little town, where they halted for some time.
The stream ran rapidly, so that it was difficult to find
a crossing, but at last they all got over. As they
scrambled up the bank, they were met by a hot fire,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
and the Mexican cavalry advanced against them. Five
of the Rangers were cut off and captured. Others
made narrow escapes, for the Mexicans now came in
close enough for hand to hand fighting, and surrounded
many of the more daring. Several of the
invaders were compelled to abandon their horses and
make a run for it across fences and ditches. A Ranger
called Sam Walker was caught by a powerful Mexican
and was held down, while others tied him. One man
named McMullins was seized by the legs as he was
getting over a fence, but his boots pulled off and he
made his escape. This was fortunate.</p>

<p>“Big Foot” Wallace was not among those first
over the creek, and advanced with the main body,
which now came on, driving the Mexicans into the
town. The troops soon entered Mier and passed down
a street leading to the public square, where the Mexicans
had planted cannon. While advancing rapidly,
they were repeatedly fired upon, and a Ranger named
Jones was killed. As he fell, he lurched against “Big
Foot” Wallace, who had felt the wind from the bullet
that laid him low. The Texans pressed on and soon
arrived at a point near the cannon, where they received
a charge of grape-shot, which made them seek shelter
behind some buildings. It was now dark. It was also
Christmas evening, but there were no peaceful revels
in Mier that winter’s day.</p>

<p>The Texans had but one way to advance: by opening
a passageway through the buildings so that they
could get in the rear of the deadly cannon. They
worked all night in digging a hole through the adobe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
walls. When daylight came, they were within fifty
yards of the death-dealing artillery.</p>

<p>“Big Foot” Wallace was among those in the very
forefront of battle. While engaged in tunnelling
through the building he discovered a Mexican baby
which had been abandoned during the hasty retreat
of the occupants of the house upon the approach of
the Texans. It set up a terrific squalling when the
Americans approached it, so “Big Foot” carefully
took it up, and, advancing to a wall enclosing a yard,
climbed up and dropped it over. At the same time, he
shouted out in Spanish:</p>

<p>“Come and get the muchacho. Quick!”</p>

<p>He soon heard a woman’s voice and supposed that
the poor infant was being taken care of.</p>

<p>Daylight dawned upon a scene of great activity.
Port-holes had been opened in the various rooms into
which the men had clambered, and the deadly crack
of the rifles was soon heard, as the Texans began to
fire at the artillerymen. The cannon were quickly
silenced, for it was death for a Mexican to venture
near them. Three attempts were made by the “Greasers”
to storm and carry the Texan position, but each
failed with fearful loss. The Mexicans, in fact, came
on so thickly packed together that it was impossible
to miss them. The bravest of all were the town
guards, who wore black hats with white bands around
them. They were nearly all killed.</p>

<p>The Texans were fighting gamely and the Mexicans
were soon forced to abandon all of their artillery.
Ropes were thrown around these instruments of war,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
from the corners of buildings, and the men from the
South succeeded in dragging some of them away.
“Big Foot” Wallace was doing a great deal of shooting.
He says that he loaded and fired his rifle fifteen
times, always waited for a good chance, and had a
bead upon a Mexican every time that he pulled the
trigger.</p>

<p>During the battle bugles sounded constantly, and it
was reported that the Mexicans were being largely
reinforced. The Texans, however, were undismayed
at this report, and continued to load and fire their
rifles with such deadly effect that great confusion
prevailed among their foes, who continually uttered
cries of rage and pain, amidst a constant blast of
bugles. They occupied the house tops, where they
kept their bodies well hid, and fired from the gutters
and from behind the chimneys. The American leader,
himself, was severely wounded, while many of the gallant
Texans lay bleeding in the narrow streets of the
quaint, little Mexican town.</p>

<p>A small guard had been left by the Rangers upon
the other side of the creek. Just after daylight, upon
the twenty-sixth of December, these attacked about
sixty of the Mexican cavalry and routed them, but,
seeing a large reinforcement approaching, they desperately
endeavored to join their comrades in the
little town. Out of the nine men who made this desperate
charge, two succeeded; four were killed; and
three were captured.</p>

<p>The fortune of war was apparently going badly
with the Mexicans, but a sudden turn of events placed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
victory in their very hands. Captain Cameron had
fortified himself and his men in the rear of a building
occupied by Fisher and his support, where he had been
exposed to a fearful fire. Upon the morning after
Christmas day he entered the room occupied by his
superior officer.</p>

<p>“Send me reinforcements,” he said, “for the
bugles are blowing the charge and I am afraid that
I will be annihilated.”</p>

<p>“I have no reinforcements,” Fisher replied. “You
will have to fight on as you are.”</p>

<p>As he ceased speaking a white flag was seen approaching
from the Mexican lines. With it was a
Doctor Sinnickson&mdash;a Texan who had been recently
captured by the Mexican troops. He had been ordered
to tell the Rangers that there were one thousand seven
hundred Mexican troops in the city, and that three
hundred more were approaching from Monterey.</p>

<p>“Ampudia says that it will be useless for you to
resist,” said the Doctor. “If you surrender, you will
be treated like prisoners of war. If you resist, no
quarter will be given!”</p>

<p>The Texan leader looked gloomily before him. He
was on foreign soil. He was hemmed in on every
side by his enemies. His men were nearly all worn
out. The streets of Mier had run red with Mexican
blood; and there was no chance to win. He was in
favor of an honorable surrender. But some thought
that they could make a sally from their barricaded
position, and, by keeping together, could fight their
way out of town and to the borders of the Rio Grande.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
These gathered around Cameron and begged him to
take command; to make a rush; and to fight a way
out. Great confusion prevailed. Some began to leave
their positions and give their guns up to their enemies.
Every few moments barricades would be torn away
and men would march out and surrender.</p>

<p>Cameron held on to his position until many had
given themselves up. Then he saw that all hope was
gone, and therefore turned to his men.</p>

<p>“Boys,” said he, “it is useless for us to continue
the fight any longer. They are all gone except ourselves.”</p>

<p>His followers stood for a few moments watching
the crowds of Mexicans, who were making a great
demonstration. Their cavalry was charging up and
down the streets, while many were carrying away
the guns of the Texans who were collected upon the
plaza. The citizens of the town were cheering for
victory.</p>

<p>“I’ll never give up,” said “Big Foot” Wallace.
“My relatives were massacred after they had surrendered
at Goliad, and that is what the Mexicans
will do to us.”</p>

<p>But Cameron wished to save the lives of his men
and so took the lead. As he marched towards the
Mexican line, his soldiers followed. When they
emerged from their position into the street they were
met by a strong detachment of Mexicans. The painful
work of surrendering their arms now commenced.
“Big Foot” Wallace was the last man to give up
his gun, his knife, and his pistol.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>The bloody battle of Mier was over. The Mexican
loss had been heavy. With two thousand in the field,
five hundred had been killed. The Texans had two
hundred and sixty in the town, sixteen of whom were
killed and thirty of whom were wounded. The Mexicans
lost forty artillerymen. The bodies of the slain
Texans were dragged through the streets by the cavalry,
and were followed by crowds of yelling townsfolk.
Four rows of dead Mexicans were laid out upon
the plaza, where the priests said mass among them.
It had been a fierce little battle.</p>

<p>Now the troubles of the Texan Rangers really commenced.
The wounded were left at the blood-bespattered
Mier in charge of the good Doctor Sinnickson,
while the able-bodied Americans were marched
towards Mexico City, in charge of General Ampudia.
Everywhere they were met by jubilant Mexicans, who
made grand demonstrations as they passed through
the towns, blowing bugles, hallooing, and charging
around upon their horses. The Texans were so
starved that they became thin and haggard, while
their shoes were worn completely through. The Mexican
women pitied the half-fed Americans, some of
whom were mere boys. At Monterrey they came in
with provisions and fed them. “Big Foot” Wallace&mdash;still
wearing the trousers which he had captured&mdash;was
thin but game. “Just give me a chance to escape,”
he muttered to a companion.” Then,&mdash;watch
me go!”</p>

<p>Finally the Texans were placed in prison at the
Hacienda Salado. Their numbers were increased by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
a few ranchers who had been captured in other raids.
All were anxious to make the attempt to escape, and
a plan was set on foot to rush the guards at sunrise
on the eleventh day of February, 1843. At Monterrey
a similar plot had been hatched, but one of the Texan
officers had disclosed it to the Mexicans, so the attempt
had not been made.</p>

<p>All was soon ready for the struggle for freedom.
Captain Cameron gave the signal by throwing up his
hat, and two scouts named Lyons and Brennan led
the charge upon the guards. The Mexicans were
taken completely by surprise, were disarmed at the
door of the prison, and saw the Texans dash into the
outer court of the building where about one hundred
and fifty infantrymen were guarding the arms and
boxes of cartridges. The Texans numbered two
hundred.</p>

<p>The frontiersmen rushed immediately upon the regular
soldiers, who levelled their muskets at them and
fired in their very faces. The Texans were not armed,
but they pressed onward, received the fire, and closed
in upon the yellow-skinned custodians of the jail. It
was too bold a dash for the Mexicans. They surrendered
or fled after the first fire, but the Texans
had other soldiers to face.</p>

<p>A second company of infantry was stationed at the
gate and a force of cavalry was outside. The gallant
Texans did not hesitate for an instant. The desperate
fellows rushed upon them, and a terrible fight ensued.
Most of them had secured guns by now, and, when the
second hand-to-hand fight took place, they were better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
prepared to force their way. “Big Foot” Wallace
did not have a gun, so he rushed at a Mexican who
had discharged his piece, and tried to disarm him.
The fellow had a bayonet upon the end of his musket.
He made a vicious thrust at the gaunt and lanky man
from Texas.</p>

<p>“Big Foot” seized the bayonet with his bare hands,
and a hard struggle took place for the possession of
it. As they bent to and fro, an unarmed prisoner
came up behind, and, seizing the gun in the centre,
wrested it from the Mexican. The soldier fell upon
his knees, held up his hands, and called out loudly:
“Señors, have mercy! Have mercy!”</p>

<p>“You can go,” shouted “Big Foot” Wallace.</p>

<p>The fight was now raging fiercely and the scout
went into the thick of it, brandishing the musket which
he had just captured, and doing awful execution with
the bayonet. The Texans were getting nearer and
nearer to the gate which opened upon the streets of
the town. The Mexicans were uttering screams and
yells of terror and surprise. The Rangers were among
them with clubbed guns and were delivering blows to
the right and left. The cavalry became terror-stricken
and fled. The infantrymen at the gate began to throw
down their arms and try to surrender.</p>

<p>One Mexican lieutenant showed extraordinary bravery.
His name was Barragan,&mdash;a son of the commander
of the Mexican force. Backing against a wall,
he brandished his sword aloft, and refused to surrender
except to an officer. Six Texans surrounded
him and thrust bayonets at his breast, but he kept his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
arm in motion and successfully parried every thrust.
His sabre was moved about with such rapidity that
it could hardly be seen.</p>

<p>At this time “Big Foot” Wallace came up.
“Here,” cried a Texan, “you shoot this fellow, ‘Big
Foot.’ He deserves death.”</p>

<p>But the lanky Texan shook his head. “No,” said
he. “This man deserves better treatment, for he is
a brave soldier. I refuse to shoot him.”</p>

<p>“Let me see your Captain,” cried the Mexican.
“To him I will surrender my sword.”</p>

<p>Captain Cameron came up at once and the blade
was turned over to him. With a proud look the Mexican
stepped back and folded his arms.</p>

<p>“You are a brave man,” said Cameron. “You
must be our prisoner, but you will not be injured.”</p>

<p>The Texans were now masters of the situation.
They dictated terms to their enemies, one of which
was that the wounded should be well taken care of.
Meanwhile they prepared for instant flight, for they
knew that a large force would soon be on their trail.
Some of the Mexicans had tied their horses near by,
and these were at once seized.</p>

<p>By ten o’clock in the morning the Texans were all
mounted and set out for the Rio Grande. It was
touch and go with them. The chances for their getting
away were very slight, for they did not know
the country.</p>

<p>“Big Foot” Wallace had secured a fine dun-colored
mule which had belonged to a Mexican officer.
The other Texans had good mounts, and by midnight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
were fifty miles from the scene of their battle. A
short halt was made and the horses were fed. The
men slept two hours, and, early in the morning, left
the main road so as to go around the city of Saltillo.
They soon abandoned the road for the mountains.
This was a fatal mistake, for it was a barren waste
with no water and no food.</p>

<p>For six days the gallant Texans pressed onward.
They were soon perishing with thirst and starvation.
So hungry were they that horses were killed and eaten.
The Texans drank the blood of their mounts, and,
leaving the remains of their slaughtered beasts for
the coyotes and buzzards, they plunged into the arid,
brown mountains in a vain endeavor to reach the Rio
Grande. Many were on foot. Some became delirious
and wandered away to die in lonely ravines. The
party became badly scattered. “Big Foot” Wallace
dried some mule meat in the sun and carried it along
in a haversack. The frontiersmen toiled onward in
the direction of the Rio Grande, but the Mexican cavalry
was hot upon their trail.</p>

<p>Finally the yellow-skinned soldiers of the country
began to come up with the half-dead Texans and to
capture them. The majority of the invaders formed
a hollow square and refused to surrender unless they
could do so as prisoners of war. They were hollow-cheeked,
sunken-eyed and half alive, yet they cried
out that they would fight unless granted an honorable
surrender. The Mexicans were well mounted and
well fed. They had the Rangers at their mercy, yet
they granted them what they asked for. Of one hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
and ninety-three Texans who had made their
escape, five died of thirst and starvation, four got
through to Texas, and three were never heard of
again.</p>

<p>The Texans were tied together with ropes and were
marched in a single line to Saltillo. When they were
brought into the city an order was received from
Santa Anna to have them shot. The Mexican officer
in charge of the prisoners refused to comply, and
said that he would resign his commission before he
would do so. The British consul also interfered, so
the poor Texans were allowed to go on to Salado,
where they had had their fierce battle for freedom.
They were placed in irons. As they reached the town
an order came from Santa Anna to have every tenth
man shot.</p>

<p>When the prisoners arrived at the jail from which
they had so gloriously escaped, some Mexicans were
seen digging a ditch. “Big Foot” Wallace nudged
a companion. “That ditch is for us!” said he. He
was quite right.</p>

<p>The Mexican officers now decided to let the prisoners
draw lots in order to see who should, and who
should not be, shot. A large jar was filled with beans:
as many beans as Texans. White and black beans
were there. The white ones meant life; the black,&mdash;death.
There were nine white beans to one black.</p>

<p>The Texans were now marched out from their jail
and were formed in a long line. An officer soon approached
with the jar in his hand, in which were one
hundred and fifty-nine white beans and seventeen black<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
ones. The poor Texans were to pass through a fearful
ordeal, but they were all gamblers with life, so
they took it philosophically. Soldiers will rush to
almost certain death in the excitement of battle, but
to stand and decide one’s fate by the drawing of a
bean is worse than charging upon a spitting cannon.</p>

<p>The Mexican officers were very anxious to kill Captain
Cameron, the gallant leader of the gaunt and
half-starved Texans. They were therefore in great
hopes that he would draw a black bean, and, for this
reason, placed black beans on top, within the jar. He
was also requested to draw first.</p>

<p>But one of the captives&mdash;a fellow named “Bill”
Wilson&mdash;saw the trick, and, as Cameron placed his
hand in the jar, the Ranger called out: “Dip deep,
Captain! Dip deep!”</p>

<p>Cameron followed his advice, ran his fingers to the
bottom, and pulled out a white bean. A look of satisfaction
passed over the faces of the Texans, for they
all loved the brave and unselfish Captain. The Mexicans
scowled as the drawing went rapidly on.</p>

<p>All “dipped deep” and it was thus some time before
a black bean was pulled forth. The Texans knew that
some of them would be compelled to draw the black
beans, but they grinned with delight as friend after
friend extracted a white bean from the fateful jar.
Most of the scouts showed the utmost coolness. One
noted gambler from Austin, Texas, stepped up to the
jar with a smile, saying: “Boys, this is the largest
stake that I ever played for!” When he drew out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
his hand a black bean was between thumb and forefinger.
Without changing the smile on his face, he
muttered: “Just my luck! Good-by to dear, old
Texas!”</p>

<p>One young fellow, almost a boy, drew a black bean,
and giving one appealing look at his comrades, cried
out:</p>

<p>“Boys, avenge my death on these hounds!”</p>

<p>As the drawing progressed, some of the petty Mexican
officers did all in their power to annoy the prisoners.
When one would draw a black bean they
would express great sorrow, and would say: “Cheer
up! Better luck next time!” although they knew
that this was the last chance which the poor fellow
would ever have.</p>

<p>One witty Texan cried out, when his time came to
draw:</p>

<p>“Boys, I had rather draw for a Spanish horse and
lose him!” He drew a white bean.</p>

<p>The time approached for “Big Foot” Wallace to
have his turn, for the men drew in alphabetical order,
and W was well down upon the list. The boys were
“dipping deep” and nearly all of the white beans had
been dipped out. As “Big Foot” reached into the
jar there were about an equal number of black beans
and white. His hand was so large that he had difficulty
in squeezing it down to the beans.</p>

<p>The wily Ranger was under the impression that the
black beans were a little larger than the white ones,
so he scooped up two against the side of the vessel,
and, getting them between his fingers, felt them with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
great care. The Mexicans were watching him very
closely. “Hurry up!” cried one. “If you pull out
two beans and one of them is a black one, you will
have to take the black.”</p>

<p>“Big Foot” paid no attention to this remark. Life
was now at stake. He deliberately felt the beans for
some time and one seemed to be larger than the other.
He let it go, drew out his hand, and breathed easier.
He had drawn out a white bean. The next two men
drew black.</p>

<p>The black beans had now all been extracted, and
the last three Texans did not draw. An officer turned
up the jar and three white beans fell to the ground.
The condemned men were then placed in a row and
the firing squad was detailed and counted off.</p>

<p>The irons were now taken from the unfortunate
Texans and they were led away to execution, bidding
their more fortunate companions good-by, as they
moved off. Tears were running down the cheeks of
the emaciated Texans as they bade their comrades a
last adieu. A man named Whaling asked not to be
blindfolded, saying that he wished to look the man
in the face that shot him, and show them how a Texan
could die. His request was refused.</p>

<p>The bold and intrepid Texan Rangers were now
ready for execution. All were blindfolded, a sharp
order rang out, and the crash of muskets woke the
echoes of the high adobe walls of the quaint, rambling
prison. Without a sound the condemned Texans fell
to the ground, all of them dead save one. This man&mdash;a
fellow named Shepherd&mdash;was wounded in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
shoulder, although a Mexican musket was within a
few feet of him when it had been fired. He feigned
death, so that he was able to crawl off and escape to
the mountains after the Mexicans had gone away.
But the men of the south discovered that one of their
victims had disappeared when they came to remove
the bodies to the ditch which had been prepared for
them. Scouts were sent out in every direction to hunt
for the missing corpse. In ten days the Ranger was
retaken and was shot.</p>

<p>The survivors&mdash;in irons&mdash;were started on foot
for the City of Mexico. They were half starved.
They were derided, hooted at, and beaten by the populace.
“Big Foot” Wallace suffered terribly, for
the shackles were too small and cut deep into the flesh.
His arms became badly swollen.</p>

<p>When the poor prisoners arrived at San Louis
Potosi, the Governor’s wife came to look at the half-fed
men and particularly noted the condition of Wallace.
Her sympathies were at once aroused and she
ordered the chains to be taken off. The officer who
commanded the Mexican troops refused to do so,
saying that only the Governor had authority to give
such an order.</p>

<p>“I am the Governor’s wife,” replied the woman.
“I command you&mdash;in his name&mdash;to take off these
terrible bands.”</p>

<p>To this the soldier consented. Sending for a blacksmith,
he had the shackles removed. The Governor’s
wife bathed the swollen arms of “Big Foot” Wallace
with her own hands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>“You should be President of Mexico,” said the
half-dead Ranger.</p>

<p>The prisoners were marched onward and soon arrived
at an Indian village about eighteen miles from
the City of Mexico. Here an order came from Santa
Anna to shoot Captain Ewing Cameron. He had
drawn a white bean, but the Mexican leader did not
respect his former decision. The order was kept a
secret from the balance of the prisoners out of fear
that they would make a demonstration. That night
Cameron was put in a room alone, with a separate
guard. The rest of the prisoners suspected some
treachery and were fearful of the fate of their brave
leader.</p>

<p>Next morning, when they were all marched out,
each Texan filled his shirt full of rocks, determined
to die for their captain if need be.</p>

<p>“Why are you getting those rocks?” asked the
guards.</p>

<p>“It is for ballast,” replied “Big Foot” Wallace.
“We want to walk better.”</p>

<p>The Mexican soldiers made no attempt to take the
stones away. They were probably afraid to do so,
as they saw a desperate look upon the faces of the
Rangers. As they marched on, the prisoners frequently
inquired about Cameron and wanted to know
if he were going to be shot.</p>

<p>“No! No!” replied the Mexicans. “Go on!
Your Captain will soon be with you!”</p>

<p>Somewhat reassured, the Rangers went forward,
but, when they were about a mile from the town, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
heard a platoon of soldiers fire their muskets in their
rear. Some one cried out: “Brave Cameron has been
massacred, boys! A finer man never breathed!”</p>

<p>It was only too true. The patriotic Texan had met
his death unflinchingly,&mdash;a victim of the treachery
of the wily Santa Anna.</p>

<p>Texas was then an independent Republic, for it had
not yet been admitted into the Union. The United
States had nothing to do with protecting the citizens
of Texas, and the young Republic did not have forces
enough to invade Mexico with an army, so as to rescue
these unfortunate men. The British consul, however,
had a good deal to say about the killing of Cameron,
and had a personal interview with Santa Anna
regarding it. He severely condemned this cruel procedure.</p>

<p>The Rangers were now closely confined in a miserable
dungeon. Many went insane and died.
Twenty-four succeeded in digging their way out,
underneath the wall. Four scaled over the high
enclosure and made their way back to Texas in safety.
“Big Foot” Wallace, himself, had a fit of temporary
insanity, but he recovered and managed to live through
the months of terrible imprisonment. The Texans
were so badly fed that they caught the rats which ran
across the dungeon floor and ate them. Meanwhile
Santa Anna’s wife was continually pleading with her
husband to liberate the miserable men. The stern
dictator was greatly attached to her, and would grant
almost anything that she asked.</p>

<p>Friends of the Texans were using their best endeavors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
to have the prisoners released. Through the
influence of his father and Governor McDowell of
Virginia, “Big Foot” Wallace was finally set free.
Upon the fifth day of August, 1844, he and four
others were allowed to go, after an imprisonment of
twenty-two months. Upon the same day the good
wife of Santa Anna died,&mdash;regretted and beloved by
every Texan who had worn the chains of Mexico.
Soon afterwards an order came to set free the remainder
of the Texans, for Santa Anna had promised
his wife&mdash;on her death-bed&mdash;that he would
release them. To his honor be it said that he kept
his promise.</p>

<p>The intrepid “Big Foot” was, of course, delighted
with his freedom. Taking ship at Vera Cruz, he soon
reached New Orleans, and from there found his way
back to his old cabin upon the Medina River. Many
settlers had taken up ranches near by, so he was no
longer alone. Still the Indians were very thick, and
there were frequent brushes with the wild riders of
the plains.</p>

<p>One day&mdash;near Fort Inge&mdash;the pioneer discovered
the track of the famous Big Foot Indian, where
he and six followers had crossed the road. The old
fellow’s footprint was fourteen inches in length, and,
as he had seen it several times before, the plainsman
knew that there was trouble in the wind. When he
reached the fort, he found a friend of his named Westfall.</p>

<p>“That Big Foot redskin is around,” said he. “This
means horse stealing. If the old cuss does get your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
stock, just let me know and I will join you in a little
Injun round-up.”</p>

<p>“All right,” Westfall replied. “If I need you,
I will let you know.”</p>

<p>As Wallace expected, in three or four days a Ranger
came after him with the information that all of Westfall’s
horses had been stolen and that he was needed&mdash;very
badly needed&mdash;to assist in their recapture.
The Indians had ridden up the Nueces Canyon to its
source, and then had crossed over to the headwaters
of the South Llano, where they had gone into camp
in a dense cedar grove. They thought that they had
captured all of the white men’s horses, and so would
not be followed. As they had shot a small bear, they
proceeded to cook it over a glowing fire.</p>

<p>But the redskins did not remember that the white
settlers had some very good mules, which they had
not captured. On these the Texans followed the
Indian trail, and soon located the redskin encampment
by the smoke from the fire. Westfall rested, but did
not cook anything. He was waiting for morning,
before making the attack.</p>

<p>As day dawned, the plainsman crept towards the
Indian camp; accompanied by a youth named Preston
Polly. The other men&mdash;four in number&mdash;were
told to come on when they heard his gun. At first
the two whites descended into the bed of a gorge to
a point opposite the camp of the famous Big Foot
Indian. When nearing the smoke from the fire, a
trail was discovered, which led down the hill to a pool
of water fed by two deep springs. Below the pool<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
was some rank, coarse grass. Westfall and the boy
halted in this.</p>

<p>Suddenly, as he peered beneath some bushes, Westfall
saw an Indian coming towards the pool of water.
He was mounted upon a pie-bald pony, and was a tall,
well-formed brave. The plainsman lay still, scarcely
daring to breathe. Silently he cocked his rifle and
kept his eyes upon the savage.</p>

<p>In a few moments the Indian came into full view.
The heart of the plainsman beat quickly, for before
him was the terrible Big Foot: his face all daubed
up with vermilion paint, and eagle feathers in his
scalp-lock. Motioning to the boy to remain absolutely
quiet, Westfall slowly raised his rifle. At this moment
the horse discovered the ambushed marksman and
snorted. Big Foot turned quickly in order to see
what was the matter and was for a moment stationary.
Bang! The burly chieftain&mdash;the scourge
and terror of the border&mdash;pitched forward upon
his face. He had been shot clean through the
heart.</p>

<p>True to their orders to approach when they heard
the discharge of a rifle, the other men came up quickly,
on the run. They charged up the hill, past the body
of the dead chief, and into the camp of the red men.
The Indians had gone, but the stolen horses were all
in camp, except those ridden away by the redskins.
The pioneers ate a good portion of the bear meat,
which was fat, juicy, and well roasted.</p>

<p>When they examined the big chief, they found that
he was indeed the giant of a man, for he was seven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
feet tall and weighed about three hundred pounds.
His hand clutched the bridle-reins so firmly that his
pony was unable to pull away from him. His hair
was fully a yard in length and he had strong arms and
legs. Upon his right knee was the mark of a bullet
where he had been wounded some years before. The
white men took his moccasins in order to prove that
it was the real Big Foot; rounded up their horses;
and were soon travelling back to their ranches. The
great chief was buried without ceremony.</p>

<p>“Big Foot” Wallace was shortly afterwards commissioned
by the Governor of Texas to raise a company
of Rangers for frontier defense. He was made
Captain and appointed his friend Westfall a Lieutenant.
They were soon to see plenty of stiff fighting.</p>

<p>The hardest battle which they engaged in was on
Todos Santos (All Saints) Creek, at a place called
the Black Hills, sixteen miles from the town of Cotulla.
Eighty redskins were near this spot, and had
camped near a waterhole, which the whites wished to
get to, as they had been three days without water.
The plainsmen had come through prickly pear and
cat-claw bushes only to find the Indians in their path.
A stiff fight ensued. The Rangers circled around the
savages for over an hour, and, after they had wounded
a good many, charged the remainder. There was
hand-to-hand fighting, but the red men were finally
driven away, leaving twenty-two of their number dead
upon the ground, among whom was their chief. “Big
Foot” Wallace had dispatched him with a rifle, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
had been presented to him by Colonel James Bowie,
from whom the bowie knife took its name.</p>

<p>The redoubtable Wallace was one of the first to enlist
in the Mexican War of 1846, and served under the
famous Texan Jack Hays. The war, as you know,
was brought on by a dispute over the boundary-line
between Mexico and the United States, and, as many
of the Rangers had old scores to settle with the Mexicans,
they did good service in the campaign which
ended in the capture of the City of Mexico. “Big
Foot” Wallace was a second Lieutenant and acquitted
himself nobly, particularly in the storming of Monterey,
where he captured the very officer who had held
the fatal bean-pot when the Texans were drawing for
their lives at Solado. To his credit be it said that he
let the fellow go.</p>

<p>The famous plainsman never married, although he
was once engaged to a belle of Austin, Texas. He
was taken ill, shortly after pledging his troth, and had
the misfortune to lose all of his hair. As soon as he
was able to travel, he left town and hid himself in a
cave in the mountains. Here he resided until his hair
grew out again. Meanwhile his sweetheart had grown
tired of waiting for him and had married another man.
As she turned out to be a terrible scold, he was lucky.</p>

<p>The old scout was the proud possessor of four dogs&mdash;half-bred
specimens&mdash;which he prized very highly.
He called them Rock, Ring, Speck and Blas, and was
particularly fond of Rock, who was so well trained
that he could follow an Indian by his scent. Wallace
could always tell by the dog’s actions when Indians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
were around, and, when night came, would feel perfectly
secure when his pets were on guard near by.
The faithful animals would lie near him and would
make no noise unless some wild man, or still wilder
animal, approached.</p>

<p>One morning Rock gave unmistakable signs that
Indians were near by, so the scout took his gun in
order to watch for the redskins. As none put in an
appearance, he told his dogs to “go on and find.”
They rushed forward, yelping, and he soon heard
them baying loudly. Coming to the spot, he saw an
Indian down in a gully with the dogs around him.
They were endeavoring to bite him, but he kept them
from seizing him by throwing his blanket over their
heads. Wallace raised his gun to fire, but, seeing that
the poor redskin was afraid, he lowered his piece.
Then, calling his pets to his side, he made signs to
the Indian to come towards him.</p>

<p>When the redskin approached, “Big Foot” saw
that he was unarmed, save for a small knife which
he held in his right hand. This was broken in two.</p>

<p>“I have been a captive among the Comanches,”
said the red man. “I have had nothing to kill game
with and am nearly starved. Pray give me something
to eat, Señor. I broke my knife while trying to open
a terrapin.”</p>

<p>The old scout’s heart was touched by the sad spectacle
before him. He took pity on the poor savage,
and, leading him to his cabin, there gave him all that
he could eat. He then turned him over to the Indian
agent at San Antonio. This shows that, although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
keen in pursuing hostile redskins, the famous Ranger
could be also kind and gentle to the unfortunate.</p>

<p>The fame of “Big Foot” Wallace was great among
the pioneers of Texas; so great, in fact, that when he
appeared at the Dallas fair in 1898, hundreds crowded
around him in order to take his hand and talk with
the famous scout. All had heard of the giant plainsman
and wanted to see him. Shortly after Christmas,
of this year, he caught a heavy cold, and died on the
seventh of January, 1899, in his eighty-third year.
To the very end his eyesight was so keen that he had
no need of glasses, and he was apparently hale and
hearty up to the last. Thus peacefully closed the
career of one of the most adventurous men who ever
hunted, fished, and fought the red men and Mexicans
upon the wide plains of Texas.</p>

<p>Although buried in Medina County, where he had
built his first log cabin, shortly after his death, a bill
was passed in the legislature, so that his remains
were taken up and were deposited in the State cemetery
at Austin. This was a city which he had helped
to build. He had also assisted in the construction of
the first well which had been sunk there. He had
been among those who had killed the last herd of
buffalo on the plains near by.</p>

<p>Here&mdash;in the peace of the rolling plain&mdash;lies
the last of the Great Captains of those gallant Rangers
of the Texan prairie. His spirit slumbers where
the coyote and Indian once followed the dun-colored
herds of buffalo, and where&mdash;in the blue azure of
the cloudless sky&mdash;the wheeling vulture watched the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
canvas-covered wagons of the emigrant trains, which
brought a people who were to construct great and
populous cities, where was then only dust and desolation.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CAPTAIN JACK HAYS:</h2>

<p class="pch">FAMOUS TEXAN RANGER AND
COMMANDER OF VALIANT
BORDER FIGHTERS</p>

<p class="drop-cap03">IT was the year 1840. Texas was still a wild
country, but the white settlers were pressing forward
to farm and to raise cattle and horses. The
redskins did not like it. The Comanches were particularly
troublesome: they had been severely chastised
by General Burleson and a Colonel John H. More, so
they had sworn to revenge themselves upon the white-skinned
invaders. With a large body of painted warriors
they made a raid upon the defenseless settlers of
Texas. They sacked and burned the town of Linnville,
partly destroyed Victoria, and commenced their
retreat back to the mountains with a great deal of
plunder. There were six hundred warriors and many
squaws in the party of invasion.</p>

<p>In going down from the mountains the Indians had
kept between the rivers, where there were no settlements,
and consequently they were not discovered
until a short time before the attack upon Linnville.
Runners were immediately sent to the various settlements,
and men began to cut across the country in
small squads from the valleys of the Colorado, the
Guadalupe, and San Marcos. All of them were excited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
and eager for revenge, none more so than General
Burleson, who&mdash;at the head of a large company&mdash;was
just starting for the scene of action. When about
one hundred and fifty men had arrived&mdash;among them
settlers from Guadalupe and San Marcos&mdash;they
started for the Indians.</p>

<p>Among those who came riding to the defense of
the Texan frontier was a splendid looking, young fellow,
who was the perfect picture of manly vigor.
Clad in blue shirt, buckskin chaparejos (large trousers
slipping over those usually worn) and high-heeled
boots, the youthful Texan was a noble example of
health and agility. A broad sombrero was upon his
head, while a cartridge-belt hung about his supple
waist. His name was John Coffee Hays; better
known as Jack Hays: the Ranger.</p>

<p>This celebrated scout and Indian fighter had been
named after General Coffee, who commanded a brigade
in the army of General Jackson, at the battle of
New Orleans. He had been born in Wilson County,
Tennessee, in 1818, but had come to Texas in 1837,
when but nineteen years of age. A surveyor by profession,
he had taken up a residence at San Antonio,
where he was employed to measure lands upon the
frontier. His life in the open had given him a hardy
constitution, and no one could endure more hardships
or privations than he. His talent as a commander
and director of rough-and-ready fighters early developed,
and he was soon among the leaders of the borderers
in Southwest Texas.</p>

<p>With a wild hurrah, which spelled REVENGE, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
large letters, the Texans started after the Indians, and,
after travelling for nine miles upon their broad trail,
caught up with them near a winding stream called
Plum Creek. Two redskins had been left by the invaders
as spies. They were upon a ridge and sat
quietly upon their horses, watching the approach of the
white men, until the Texans were almost within gun-shot.
Both of these Indians had on tall hats which
they had obtained at the looting of Linnville. You can
well imagine how comical they looked, for a black,
stovepipe hat hardly becomes a wild rider of the plains.
With his thick, long hair it never quite fits, and it
certainly gives the red man a most grotesque appearance.</p>

<p>One of the Texan Rangers had a long-range gun.
Dismounting, he cried out:</p>

<p>“Boys! Just watch me make the redskins hump!”</p>

<p>At the crack of his rifle, the Indians wheeled their
horses in order to run away. As they did so, both lost
their plug hats. They moved swiftly to their comrades,
warning them of the approach of the Rangers,
who spread out in a fan-shaped line, and kept on after
the retreating braves.</p>

<p>Now began a hot fight. The redskins were well
armed and made a good showing, but nothing could
withstand the terrible fire of the Texan rifles. After
an hour of rapid shooting the Rangers charged with
a wild, ear-splitting whoop. Jack Hays was well up
in front of the line as they did so. The Indians broke
and galloped away in a disorganized mass.</p>

<p>Many of the redskins had on fine coats and boots<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
which they had stolen during the raid. Some of
them even carried umbrellas. Their spare horses and
mules were packed with stolen goods, and these were
driven ahead by the squaws, while the warriors fought
the battle. After about a mile of fighting, the Comanches
rallied in large force and a sharp contest ensued.
But they could not stand the accurate rifle-fire
from the Texans, and again fled in a scattered mass.</p>

<p>The pursuit continued in hot haste, for some high
mountains were in front, and the Rangers knew that
if the red men once reached them it would be quite
possible for them to get away. Many of the pack-animals
now gave out, were abandoned, and fell into
the hands of the Texans. A boggy branch was in the
path of the retreating braves. Several of the Indian
ponies stuck fast in the mire: all of the pack-animals
which had not yet been captured, became hard aground
in the mud. The hindmost Indians used some of the
poor, bogged animals as pontoons, and passed over
the marsh by jumping from body to body. The Texans
saw the predicament which the redskins were in
and ran around the branch to the other side, where
they cut off some of the Indians who were on foot,
and killed them. The rest got away to the foot of
the mountains, where the pursuit ended.</p>

<p>The Rangers collected at the spot where the fight
had been most severe and where most of the Indians
had been dispatched. Here they camped for the
night. Some of the Texans had been wounded, but
none had been killed. Thus the battle of Plum Creek
came to a glorious end.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

<p>Jack Hays had certainly distinguished himself in
this affair. He distinguished himself still more in
1842, when San Antonio was captured by the Mexicans.
Shortly after the battle of Plum Creek, Jack
had been commissioned by General Houston to raise
a force for protection of the frontier. He had no
difficulty in doing this and was soon in command
of several hundred Texan Rangers. They were
wild fellows; ready for any emergency that might
arise.</p>

<p>The Mexicans had about fifteen hundred men in
San Antonio. They were commanded by a General
Wall. Jack Hays and his Rangers rode up near the
town and “dared” the Mexicans to come out and
fight. This they were quite willing to do, and soon
marched from the adobe huts of San Antonio, crossed
a creek in order to face the Texans, planted cannon,
and the battle commenced. The Rangers acted upon
the defensive, dodged the limbs of the pecan trees
which the whistling bullets began to cut off, and
prepared to meet the Mexicans when they should
charge.</p>

<p>General Wall, the Mexican leader, thought to rout
the Texans with his artillery fire, but, as he failed
to do this, he made preparations to charge them.
Cavalry was dispatched across the creek in order to
cut off retreat upon this side, and a band of Cherokee
Indians were posted upon a branch below. The Mexicans
believed that they would have an easy time of
it, but they little thought with what kind of men they
had to deal. Before them were expert riflemen: all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
keen shots and frontier fighters. They made a good
account of themselves.</p>

<p>The bugles sounded the charge and the Mexicans
came on in fine style. They were massed together
densely, and, for a time, it looked as if the Rangers
would be annihilated by mere force of numbers. But
the Texans lay down behind the creek bank, and
poured such a volley of death and destruction into
the ranks of the oncoming foe that their formation
was broken up and they retreated in confusion and
disorder to their batteries, posted upon elevated
ground. A company of their cavalry also charged,
but the horses would not come on before the sheet of
lead which the Rangers pumped into them. Many
lost their riders and ran among the infantrymen,
knocking them down as they galloped wildly about.
The Rangers cheered loudly, and Captain Jack Hays
grinned from ear to ear.</p>

<p>As the Mexicans gathered behind their cannon,
about fifty Texans, under Captain Nicholas Dawson,
came up on the right flank. They heard the sound
of firing and hurried towards it, only to find that they
had run into Wall’s entire army. The Mexicans surrounded
them immediately, and poured a destructive
fire into their ranks. What could fifty do against
one thousand? Two Texans made their escape.
About twelve were captured. The rest fell before the
bullets of the invaders. Dawson, himself, was one of
the last to go down.</p>

<p>After this, the Mexicans seemed to think that they
had had sufficient fighting. They retired towards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
San Antonio, followed by the exultant Texans. Captain
Jack Hays with his Rangers fought the rear-guard
near Hondo, but the pursuit was soon abandoned
and the frontiersmen returned to their homes.
They had lost less than one hundred in killed and
wounded.</p>

<p>The Rangers retreated to a place called Somervell,
and, not long afterwards, were ordered out to look
for Indians, which were then pretty thick in the neighborhood,
and were doing considerable damage. There
were between thirty and forty men in this expedition,
some of whom had just returned from Mexico, where
they had participated in the battle of Mier. They
moved off towards the northwest, struck the Medina
River, and kept on up the stream towards the place
where now stands the town of Bandera. Here they
made camp, and next morning turned north towards
the Bandera Pass, which they entered at about ten
o’clock in the morning.</p>

<p>The Comanches were waiting for them. They had
discovered the approach of the Rangers as they came
through the open country, and laid an ambush for
them in the Pass. The famous Bandera Pass is some
five hundred yards in length by one hundred and
twenty-five in breadth. The red men were concealed
among the rocks and gullies on both sides of the
gorge, and they allowed Captain Jack Hays with his
Texan Rangers to get about one-third of the way
through before they commenced firing from both sides
at once. The Rangers were riding three abreast, and,
when this fusillade commenced, were thrown into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
momentary confusion, because of the frightened and
wounded horses, which endeavored to wheel and run
back.</p>

<p>“Steady, boys, steady!” exclaimed Captain Jack
Hays. “Get down from your horses and tie them
to the brush. We can whip these infernal redskins
if you will only keep cool.”</p>

<p>The Comanches greatly outnumbered the Rangers.
They were armed with rifles and with bows and arrows.
Many came down the Pass and rode up to
close quarters with the Rangers. Pistols were freely
used and many hand-to-hand conflicts took place. The
Comanche chief was struck down by a ball from the
rifle of “Kit” Ackland, who, himself, was wounded
a moment later. It was a furious affair,&mdash;one of the
most desperate Indian battles of the frontier.</p>

<p>One of the scouts&mdash;a fellow named Galbreath&mdash;was
wounded by an arrow which struck him above the
pistol-belt, on the left side. It penetrated as far as
the hip bone. The hardy frontiersman made no complaint,
but drew the missile out at once, loaded his
gun, and continued to fight on as if nothing had happened.
No one knew that he had been wounded until
the worst part of the battle was over.</p>

<p>The Indians fought with great fury, but they soon
saw that they could not drive the Rangers back, and
so withdrew to the north end of the Pass. Here they
buried their dead chieftain; killed all of their crippled
horses, and held a scalp dance over the remains
of their fallen comrades. Five Rangers had been
killed and six had been wounded. The men under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
Jack Hays retreated to the south end of the Pass,
where they buried those who had met their end, and
attended to the wounded. Next morning they jogged
along to San Antonio. The Indians did not pursue.</p>

<p>The battle of Bandera Pass had taught the red men
that the Rangers were not to be trifled with. Captain
Jack was continually on the lookout for them, and
soon had another experience which he had no occasion
to forget. It happened about a year after the
famous battle at the Pass.</p>

<p>Fourteen Rangers&mdash;under Captain Jack&mdash;went
upon a scout up the Neuces Canyon, with the expectation
of meeting the Indians, who were then upon
the war-path. After a long trip to the head of the
river, without seeing any fresh Indian sign, Hays
turned back down the canyon and camped. Next day
the little party travelled onward, and&mdash;about noon&mdash;some
one discovered a bee tree.</p>

<p>“Hold on, Captain!” said a Ranger. “Just wait
a minute and I’ll chop all the honey out of that tree-top.”</p>

<p>“All right,” replied Hays. “Sail in and let’s see
what you can do. Pull your bridles off, men. Let
your ropes down and allow your horses to graze. We
will rest here awhile and get some honey.”</p>

<p>The Ranger secured a small axe that was in the
luggage on a pack-mule, and ascended the tree, for the
purpose of chopping into the honey without cutting
down this stout piece of timber.</p>

<p>About this time a large band of Comanches were
coming down the canyon on a raid, and, seeing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
trail of the Rangers, they followed it. The fellow
in the tree had a good view of the valley, and, to his
startled vision appeared a great body of redskins.</p>

<p>“Jerusalem, the Golden, Captain!” he sang out.
“Yonder come a thousand Indians! Jerusalem!”</p>

<p>The Comanches were riding rapidly down the trail
and made a good deal of dust. Hays sprang to his
feet, as quick as a cat, and sang out his orders
promptly, and to the point.</p>

<p>“Come out of that tree, there! Men, put on your
bridles! Take up your ropes! Be ready for them!
Be ready for them!”</p>

<p>All sprang to their horses, and were soon prepared
to meet the onrush of the red men.</p>

<p>The Rangers were armed with Colt’s five-shooters,
besides their rifles and a brace of holster single-shot
pistols. Thus each man could fire nine shots. The
Indians had never before come in conflict with scouts
armed with the five-shooter, and they rode on exultingly,
for they greatly outnumbered the whites.
Jack Hays never ran from Indians, and had never yet
been defeated by them.</p>

<p>The Comanches came forward, yelling loudly.
They thought that it would be an easy matter to ride
over the small squad of white men, who were drawn
up around the old bee tree. Some of the scouts began
to raise their guns, but Captain Jack cried out:</p>

<p>“Now, boys, do not shoot too quickly. Let the
redskins come closer. Hit something when you do
shoot. Stand your ground. We can whip them when
we shoot. There is no doubt about that.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span></p>

<p>The redskins thundered down upon the Rangers.
When they were quite close, Captain Jack called:</p>

<p>“Fire, and let every shot tell!”</p>

<p>A sheet of flame burst from the rifles of the scouts,
and so many ponies went down that the redskins divided
to the right and left, discharging their arrows
as they swept by.</p>

<p>At this moment Captain Jack sprang into his saddle.</p>

<p>“After them, men,” he cried. “Give them no
chance to turn on us! Crowd them! Powder-burn
them!”</p>

<p>Never was a band of redskins more surprised; for
they expected the Rangers to remain near the tree,
and upon the defensive. With a wild whoop, the followers
of Jack Hays galloped after the running
braves, keeping up a perfect fusillade with their pistols.
The Comanches were thunderstruck at this turn
of affairs. Some tried in vain to turn their horses
and make a stand, but such was the wild confusion
of running horses, popping pistols, and yelling Rangers,
that they abandoned the idea of a rally, and
sought safety in furious flight. In endeavoring to
dodge the terrible five-shooters, some dropped their
bows and round shields. Some kept off the Rangers
by thrusting at them with their long lances.</p>

<p>The Indians ran for three miles before they could
get away. The Rangers now rode back, well satisfied
with the day’s work, and were surprised to see the
result of their charge. The ground was fairly black
with dead redskins. Many years afterwards a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
friendly Delaware Indian, called “Bob,” met the
Comanche chieftain who led his warriors in this
fight.</p>

<p>“Who did you battle with upon this occasion?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“Ugh! Jack Hays and his Rangers,” gloomily replied
the Comanche chief, shaking his head. “I
never want to fight him again. Ugh! Ugh! His
soldiers had a shot for every finger on their hands.
I lost half of all my warriors. Ugh! Me never fight
with him again.”</p>

<p>The Rangers soon afterwards had another tough
little scrimmage with the Comanches. Fifteen of the
Rangers were together at this time and they met an
almost equal number of Indians, who were discovered
at the foot of the mountains near the Frio River. The
Indians were riding very tired horses, and the scouts
thus gained upon them rapidly. The red men kept
under cover, as much as possible, riding in ravines
which had brushes and prickly pears around them,
wherever they could do so.</p>

<p>Captain Jack and his men arrived at a little dried-up
creek called Ci Bolo (buffalo creek) where they came
close to the Indians, who were travelling in a ravine
which hid them from view. The Rangers heard their
leggings scraping against the brush, so, for some distance,
they rode parallel with the savages, waiting
for a chance to make a charge. The redskins could
be heard talking to each other.</p>

<p>Suddenly the Comanches left the ravine and rode
out in open view, not more than thirty yards away.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
They apparently were not aware of the presence of
the scouts until a sharp crack warned them of their
danger. At the first discharge, a redskin fell from his
horse. The others attempted to run back to cover,
yelling and shooting at the Rangers as they did so.
But the scouts were too speedy for them and cut them
off. One, however, seemed determined to get into the
ravine. He disappeared into a thicket, at the edge of
the gully, but a Ranger called Tom Galbraith dismounted,
and, running to the edge of the thicket
after the Indian had reached it, fired, and killed
him.</p>

<p>The rest of the savages endeavored to make their
escape across the open country, which was filled with
scattered bunches of the prickly pear, cactus, and cat-claw
bushes. Some were on mules, and others on
jaded horses. The Rangers rode hard after them and
fired with deadly effect. The Indians had no guns&mdash;only
bows and arrows&mdash;so they did but little damage.</p>

<p>As the chase continued, one young Ranger called
Stoke Holmes, who rode a fast little pony, singled out
an Indian and cried out:</p>

<p>“Watch me, Boys! I’m going to rope him!”</p>

<p>While he was running along and was swinging his
lariat, the pony attempted to jump a large bunch of
prickly pears. He reared so high that his rider lost
his seat in the saddle and fell backwards into the terrible
cactus. Some of his comrades saw the mishap.
They quickly shot the redskin and then came rapidly
to his rescue, as he was unable to get up. The valiant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
scout was in a sad plight. His body had thousands
of pear thorns in it, and his clothing was pinned to
him on all sides. He was in agonies of pain. Pulling
him away from the grip of the cactus, the Rangers
stripped off all of his clothing, extracted all of the
large thorns, and endeavored to pull out the small
ones. But this was an impossibility, as there were
thousands of small needle-like prickers in his flesh.
With a sharp knife the Ranger shaved them close to
the skin so that his clothing would not irritate his
body by rubbing against them. The bold young
fellow was hardly able to ride for several days thereafter.
As for the rest of the redskins,&mdash;only three
escaped.</p>

<p>Not many months later Captain Hays and his men
were close upon a band of Indians, who had been
located by his scouts in a bunch of cedars. The Rangers
had not eaten all day, because they had been hot
in pursuit.</p>

<p>“Dismount, men,” cried the captain. “Stay here a
few minutes and partake of the cold bread and beef
in your saddle-bags. But, boys, by no means raise
any smoke, or the redskins will surely see it, and will
know that the Rangers are upon their trail.”</p>

<p>“You’re right, Captain!” cried many. “We
are half famished.”</p>

<p>Captain Hays always had a few Mexicans with him,
as they were good guides and trailers, but, upon this
occasion, they lighted their cigarettes after eating and
dropped the hot ashes into a pile of leaves. Smoke
was soon curling above the tree-tops.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>

<p>“Curse it, boys!” cried Captain Hays. “Did I
not tell you not to set fire to anything. Put that out,
immediately!”</p>

<p>Some of the Rangers began to stamp upon the
glowing fire. Hays was so angry that he struck the
Mexicans with his quirt.</p>

<p>“Mount! Mount!” cried he. “We must go
quickly after the redskins, as I fear that they have
seen the tell-tale fire and have decamped.”</p>

<p>A furious run was now made for the tepees of the
hostiles, which were a mile away. It was as the
knowing Captain had anticipated. The Indians saw
the smoke and knew that the Rangers were on their
trail. They had fled, leaving many things in their
camp, which were seized by the troopers. The
Comanches had gotten safely away.</p>

<p>In 1844 Captain Hays and his men had a hard
fight,&mdash;one of his hardest, in fact. It was near the
Pedernales River. Upon this occasion he had gone
out with fourteen men, about eighty miles northwest
from San Antonio, for the purpose of finding out the
position of the redskins and the probable location of
their camp.</p>

<p>As the river came in view, about fifteen Indians were
discovered. They soon saw the Rangers. Riding
towards them, they shook their clenched fists and
seemed to be desirous of having a fight. As the
Rangers rode forward they retreated and endeavored
to lead them towards a ridge which was covered with
thick underbrush.</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” said Captain Hays, “I am too well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
acquainted with your wiles to move on. I know that
you have an ambush laid for me and my men.”</p>

<p>It was hard to keep the Rangers from advancing to
the attack.</p>

<p>“Go around the redskins to the second ridge,” cried
the knowing Captain. “We can thus get the Indians
in the rear.”</p>

<p>The Rangers were posted upon a long hillock, separated
from the Indian position by a deep ravine.
They were not here long before the redskins discovered
who was before them, and, as they knew Captain
Jack full well, decided to give up trying to catch him
by stratagem. They now showed themselves to the
number of seventy-five and cried out, in pigeon English:</p>

<p>“Come on, white men! Ugh! Come on! We
get your scalps soon!”</p>

<p>“I’ll meet you right away!” answered Captain
Hays.</p>

<p>He started down the hill immediately, followed by
his entire command. He moved slowly, and, when
the bottom of the ravine had been reached, turned&mdash;raced
ahead at full speed&mdash;and came up in the rear
of the Indians. While they had their eyes glued to
the front, eagerly awaiting the advance from that
direction, they were charged in the rear by the
Rangers. The first fire threw them into instant confusion.</p>

<p>Yells, war-whoops, and shrill screams rent the air.
The redskins scattered like quail, but, seeing the
superiority of their own force, soon rallied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></p>

<p>“Draw your five-shooters, men,” cried the Captain
of the Rangers. “We must meet the charge of the
Comanches as we have always met them.”</p>

<p>The redskins were surrounding the Texans, so the
Rangers were formed in a circle, fronting outwards.
They were still mounted on their horses, and, for several
minutes maintained that position without firing a
shot. The Indians came on, yelping, and were soon
near enough to throw their lances at the Texan frontiersmen.</p>

<p><i>Crash!</i></p>

<p>A spitting volley came from the five-shooters of
the scouts and many a red man fell to the sod. Again
a volley rang out and the Comanches ceased to advance,
for the fire of the Rangers was fearfully accurate.
The redskins fell back, but they were not defeated,
and&mdash;in a few moments&mdash;again came on to
the attack. The fight continued for an hour. Twice
the Rangers charged and retreated to their first position.
Their loads were now exhausted. The Comanche
chief was rallying his henchmen for one more
assault. Twenty-five of his painted warriors were
prostrate upon the prairie.</p>

<p>The situation was critical for the Rangers, as many
were badly wounded. Several had been killed.</p>

<p>Captain Hays, who was in the centre of the circle,
now saw that their only chance was to kill the Indian
chief.</p>

<p>“Have any of you men a loaded rifle?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“I have,” answered a scout called Gillespie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<p>“Then dismount, my boy,” said the Ranger Captain,
“and make sure work of that chief.”</p>

<p>Gillespie was a brave man. He had been badly
wounded by an Indian spear which had gone clean
through his body. He was hardly able to sit his
horse, but, slipping to the ground, took careful aim
and fired. As his rifle cracked, the chief fell head-long
from his horse.</p>

<p>It is a strange thing, but Indians always lose heart
when their leader is slain. Wailing loudly, the Comanches
now left the field, pursued by a portion of
the Texans. They carried their chieftain safely away,
in spite of the fact that they were pressed very closely
by the Rangers. Thirty Indians lay dead upon the
battle-ground, while only two of the Texan frontiersmen
had been killed. Five, however, were badly
wounded; chief among whom was Gillespie, who had
really ended the fight.</p>

<p>Captain Hays and his men went back to San Antonio
well satisfied with the day’s work. A month later
he had another desperate encounter with the Comanches.</p>

<p>With twenty of his men the gallant Ranger was on
a scout near the “Enchanted Rock.” This was a depression
in a hill, which was conical in shape, and was
doubtless the crater of an extinct volcano. A dozen
or more men could hide in this place and put up a
stout defense against a great number of enemies, as
the ascent was steep and rugged. Not far from the
bottom of this curious hillock the Rangers were attacked
by a large force of Comanches.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>

<p>When the first shot was fired, Captain Hays was
some distance from his men, looking about in order
to see whether or not he could discover the whereabouts
of the Indians. As he turned to run towards
the “Enchanted Rock,” he was cut off and was closely
pursued by a number of red warriors.</p>

<p>The nervy Captain Jack dashed madly up the side
of the hill and entrenched himself in the extinct crater.
He was determined to make the best fight that he
could, and to “sell out” as dearly as possible. The
redskins arrived upon the summit shortly after he
had entrenched, and, after surrounding the famous
Captain of Rangers, set up a most hideous howling.</p>

<p>“There, Captain Jack,” said one. “Ugh! We
get Big Smoky Stick this time. Ugh! We get scalp
this time! Ugh! Ugh!”</p>

<p>But Captain Jack was game. Each time that the
muzzle of his rifle would appear over the rim of the
crater the warriors would dodge backwards, knowing
that to face his unerring aim was sure death.</p>

<p>The Indians grew bolder and made a charge. Hays
fired his rifle, killing a redskin at the discharge,&mdash;then
shot his five-shooter at the yelping braves. Each
bullet found a victim, so the redskins withdrew, which
gave the gallant Captain a chance to reload. Again
they came on, but again they were met with the same
cool bravery. Howling dismally, they again drew
away and made ready for another attack.</p>

<p>Suddenly wild cheering sounded from below the
Ranger Captain. Shots came thick and fast. Wild
yells arose. His comrades were coming to his rescue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span></p>

<p>The Rangers had heard the rifle-fire upon the top
of the hill and knew that their Captain was surrounded.
So they were fighting their way up to him,
in spite of the odds. Soon they came cheering and
yelling to the edge of the crater, itself, to be greeted
by the cool remark:</p>

<p>“Boys, I’m sure glad to see you! I was nearly
all in!”</p>

<p>When the Comanches saw that the Big Chief had
been rescued they retreated down the steep sides of
the “Enchanted Rock.” They met their comrades,
who had been badly cut up, and, deciding that the
Rangers were too good for them, withdrew. Wild
cheers welled from the crater of “Enchanted Rock,”
and loud were the hurrahs for Texas Jack, the gallant
and intrepid Ranger.</p>

<p>The war with Mexico found Captain Jack Hays
ready and willing to march against the hated “Greasers.”
He and his famous Rangers fought in nearly
all of the desperate battles of the campaign. Many of
his faithful friends and companions fell before the
leaden missiles of the foe. But Captain Jack had a
charmed life: he came through unscathed, returned
to his beloved Texas, and then moved to California,
where he was elected Sheriff of San Francisco County.
He was very efficient as an officer and left an excellent
record behind him.</p>

<p>In 1860 he had his last Indian fight. The Piute
Indians in the state of Nevada declared war upon the
whites, in that year, and committed many depredations.
They massacred Major Ormsby and his men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
and spread terror broadcast. At this time there were
rich mines in Virginia City, and among the many men
who were employed there was an old Texan Ranger,
Captain Edward Storey, a man of great personal
courage. He was also very popular among the people.</p>

<p>“This Indian fighting has to stop, immediately,”
said the old fellow, his fighting blood again boiling.</p>

<p>At once a company was raised, called the Virginia
Rifles. Colonel Jack Hays heard of it, and immediately
came over from California in order to enlist.
With him were several other bold spirits who were
eager for the excitement of a brush with the redskins.
They marched to Pyramid Lake, not far from the
present town of Reno, and there met the exultant
braves,&mdash;about one thousand strong. They were
flushed with their recent victory over Major Ormsby
and his men, and thought that they could easily defeat
the whites.</p>

<p>In this they were mistaken. The red men were in
the hills and had the advantage of position, but the
scouts attacked with vigor and a fierce battle ensued.
Colonel Jack Hays was in the thick of the fight and
conducted himself in a manner quite worthy of his
name and fame. A complete victory was won by the
Virginia Rangers, but at a fearful loss. Among those
slain was brave Captain Storey, whose body was rolled
up in a blanket and conveyed to Virginia City on the
back of a pack-horse. Colonel Hays rode with the
remains of his old friend of the wild days on the
Texan plains, then returned to California.</p>

<p>Here the famous Indian fighter died in 1883. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
his later years he became very wealthy and owned a
beautiful home near Piedmont, California. He never
lived in Texas again, but occasionally went there, in
order to visit old friends and relatives. He was
buried with a simple ceremony, and thus ended the
career of one of the most deadly shots and courageous
men who ever rode a mustang upon the plains of the
West. His spirit still lives in the hearts of the Texans.</p>

<h2 class="p4">BILL HAMILTON:</h2>

<p class="pch">FAMOUS TRAPPER, TRADER, AND INDIAN
FIGHTER</p>

<p class="drop-cap03">THE mountaineers were pushing, adventurous
and fearless men who thought nothing of
laying down their lives in the service of a
friend. They usually carried very little with them.
A few ponies transported their meagre supplies, and,
with only enough provisions to last them a few days,
they often set out to journey through a vast wilderness.
Naturally they were very self-reliant. With
only a gun or two they took desperate risks in a country
filled with their red enemies. They overcame
every difficulty with a dash and courage that is amazing.
“Uncle Bill” Hamilton was a typical example
of one of these men.</p>

<p>From the time that he was twenty years of age this
famous old fellow spent his life on the plains. He
became a sign-talker and was able to converse with all
the Indian tribes which were met with. Sign-talking
will soon be a lost art, but in the old days all of the
red men used the same signs, although they spoke
different languages. He was also a trapper, trader,
and pathfinder. He blazed many a trail which was to
lead the frontiersmen to rich agricultural regions. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
set an example of courage and perseverance that will
leave a bright memory in the hearts of all.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1842, when twenty years of age,
young Bill was living in St. Louis, Missouri; but
chills and fever were gradually undermining his constitution,
so his doctor ordered a change of climate.
Consequently his father made arrangements with a
party of hunters and trappers, who were in St. Louis
for a few days, to let his son accompany them on
their next trip, which would last a year. The party
consisted of eight “free” traders, with “Bill” Williams
and a man named Perkins, as leaders. These two
scouts had had fifteen years’ experience on the plains
among Indians, and had a wide reputation for fearless
courage and daring exploits.</p>

<p>The trappers soon reached Independence, Missouri,&mdash;where
they sold their wagons and rigged up a
complete pack outfit, as the expedition would go
through a country in which wagons could not travel.
Young Bill Hamilton still had on city clothes, and
when the old fur traders saw this, they began to laugh
and poke fun at him.</p>

<p>“What be you going to do with that city cuss in
th’ mountains?” said one. “Why, he’ll lose himself
in a hour’s time and walk down the throat of some
grizzly bear.”</p>

<p>Young Bill did not like this remark at all, and hurrying
to a frontier store he traded his “store clothes”
for two suits of the finest buckskin. When he appeared
in camp with these fine togs on one of the
mountaineers said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>

<p>“Williams, that boy o’ yourn will make a fine old
pioneer and mountaineer, if he catches on at this rate.”</p>

<p>The youthful plainsman heard it and smiled, for he
had felt very badly before.</p>

<p>The party pushed onward and reached Salt Creek.
Camp had just been made when a small herd of buffalo
appeared in the distance and made directly for
the little band. Williams gave orders to corral all
the stock, for he feared that this was the game of
some plains Indians, and he was not far from being
correct. The stock had barely been secured when the
buffalo thundered by, followed by thirty painted
Kiowa warriors. They were wild and savage.</p>

<p>The trappers had placed their packs in a triangle,
and crouched behind them. This made an excellent
breastwork. Each man was armed with a rifle, two
pistols, a tomahawk, and a large knife, called a
“tooth-picker.” Two of the men had bows and arrows
with which they were experts.</p>

<p>The redskins rode up insolently; examined the outfit,
and demanded pay for passing through their country.</p>

<p>“You can neither touch our traps nor will we give
you pay for riding through your country,” said Williams.
“This is Pawnee country and you are Kiowas.”</p>

<p>The Indians seemed to be ill pleased and looked
vindictively at the sturdy men of the plains. The
leader was given some tobacco. He was not a chief,
but a young brave with two feathers stuck in his scalp-lock.
After receiving this gift the savages withdrew,
saying: “Ugh! Ugh! We come again!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>

<p>The trapper kept close watch during the night, expecting
that the Indians would attempt to steal some
of the stock and attack the camp. But nothing occurred.
Many outfits have come to grief by putting
confidence in the red man, who always covets
the belongings of the paleface. Old and experienced
mountain men like these left nothing to
chance.</p>

<p>Pretty soon the trappers reached the camp of some
Cheyennes and there unpacked their goods in order
to trade. Young Bill accompanied the chief’s son,
Swift Runner, through the village, who introduced
him to all the leading men.</p>

<p>“There will be a large hunting party starting out
to-morrow after buffalo,” said he, “and if you wish
to go along I will furnish you with a good hunting
horse.”</p>

<p>“I shall be delighted to go,” cried young Bill, so
next morning found him riding across the prairie with
about fifty Indians and twenty squaws.</p>

<p>After travelling for nearly ten miles the scouts discovered
a herd and reported its location to the hunting
chief. This leader was thoroughly acquainted with
the topography of the country and led the redskins
upon a long détour, so as to get on the leeward side
of the herd. As soon as a favorable position had
been reached the Indians stripped to their breech-clouts
and advanced, leading their running horses as
they did so.</p>

<p class="vh"><a name="i323" id="i323">i323</a></p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-323.jpg" width="450" height="304"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pc">AN INDIAN BUFFALO HUNT.</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>

<p>The chief now divided the hunters into two divisions,
in order to get the buffalo into a small area.
They rode to within a quarter of a mile of the herd
and then the word was given to “Sail in!”</p>

<p>In an instant the wild array of naked Indians
started for the herd, sending forth yell after yell, and
riding like demons in their eagerness to bring down
the first buffalo. For this is quite a feat and is commented
upon by the whole village.</p>

<p>Swift Runner, himself, had the fastest horse in the
party and brought down the first buffalo, much to the
chagrin of many a young brave&mdash;who coveted the
honor&mdash;for it would bring him smiles from his lady
love. Young Bill’s pony loped along with willingness,
and Swift Runner pointed out a fat cow for him to
dispose of. In a few jumps he was alongside of the
great lumbering brute, and fired into her side. As
luck would have it, he broke her back and she dropped
to the sod. Swift Runner yelled hilariously at this
success, but it was a very careless shot, and, had he
missed, the cow might have made things ugly for him.</p>

<p>There was a great yelling and shooting upon every
hand and several riderless ponies were mixed in with
the buffalo. Many prairie-dog holes were the cause
of this, for when the ponies stepped into them their
riders were, of course, thrown over their heads.
Ponies are usually sure-footed beasts, but when in
a chase like this, where over a thousand buffalo are
tearing over the prairie and kicking up a big lot of
dust, it makes it impossible for the animals to see the
holes.</p>

<p>Young Bill brought down four of the huge brown
bison and received great praise from the Indians for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
his skill. They used arrows in their killing and shot
behind the shoulder, bringing the buffalo to his knees.
Another arrow would be sent deep enough to penetrate
the lungs of the beast and it would then be soon over
with him.</p>

<p>For three-quarters of a mile the prairie was dotted
with the dead buffalo. They were soon butchered;
the ponies were packed with three hundred pounds of
the choicest meat, and the caravan started for home.
Several Indians who had been thrown limped quite
badly, but no one was seriously injured. At sundown
the village was reached, a feast was prepared, and all
joined in the affair with the greatest good will and
friendship. Young Bill was warmly congratulated
upon his success, and this was well, for if a white
man fails to acquit himself creditably with the redskins
it casts a reflection upon all the whites.</p>

<p>The Indians made pemmican and “dupuyer” from
the buffalo. The first is manufactured in the following
manner: the choicest portions of the buffalo meat
are selected, sliced, and cut into flakes. They are then
dried. All of the marrow, from the centre of the
bones, is put into one pile with the sweetest of the tallow.
These ingredients are mixed together and stirred
around in a pot which is hung over a slow fire. The
combination is then cooled. Some red men put berries
into the mixture, which harden and give a sweetish
taste. The mountaineers and trappers&mdash;when sugar
was scarce&mdash;always made their pemmican in this
manner. The Indian squaws pulverized the meat by
beating it upon a flat rock, and then placed it in skinbags<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
for future use. It is estimated that one pound
of pemmican is equal to about five pounds of beef.</p>

<p>A fat substance which lies along the buffalo’s backbone,
next to the hide, is known as “dupuyer.” It
is about as thick as the hand of a trapper and runs
from the shoulder-blade to the last rib. In breadth
it measures between seven to eleven inches. The Indians
and mountaineers would strip away this substance&mdash;dip
it in hot grease for thirty seconds&mdash;and
then hang it to the inside poles of a lodge. A
fire would be lighted beneath it and it would be allowed
to dry and smoke for ten or twelve hours.
“Dupuyer” was considered to be a great delicacy,
for it was very nourishing. Besides this it was tender
and sweet. The trappers loved this food and would
pay a dollar a pound for it, while the Indians always
took dried meat and “dupuyer” along with them upon
their expeditions.</p>

<p>When Williams and his party moved on, Swift Runner
presented young Bill with a pony which he had
ridden in the hunt, and the squaws gave him a half
a dozen pairs of beautifully embroidered moccasins.</p>

<p>A few days later the party reached the South Platte
River and there found a Sioux village. Big Thunder
was the chief, and he requested the trappers to camp
there, as his people wanted to trade with them. The
Sioux were then a friendly tribe and treated the
white men in a cordial manner.</p>

<p>Just before dawn&mdash;upon the day following&mdash;a
wild yelping awoke the entire village. The warriors
ran out only to find that the Pawnees&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
mortal enemies of the Sioux&mdash;had run off about one
hundred head of ponies which had been turned out to
graze only a short distance from camp. Among this
number were two mules and three ponies belonging
to the white men.</p>

<p>As soon as this news was received there was a
great yelling and shouting, while fifty young warriors
hastened to saddle their best ponies. Young Bill
Hamilton was with them, and, under the leadership
of Young Thunder, they started after the redskins.
The trail of the fugitives was soon struck and followed
at a brisk gallop, and, after going about eight miles,
it was evident that the Pawnees were but a short distance
in advance. Passing over a divide, a cloud of
dust could be plainly seen about two miles in advance.</p>

<p>The Pawnees rode hard, but they were soon in
view. There were twelve in the party. As Young
Thunder gave a war-whoop, the ponies bounded forward
and carried their owners towards the fugitives
as if shot out of the mouth of a cannon. The Pawnees
heard the chief’s yell, and, leaving the herd of
stolen stock, made for a neighboring cottonwood
grove. While Bill Hamilton rode onward, a bullet
whistled by his ear. The savages fired several more
shots but their lead all went wide of its mark.</p>

<p>“Don’t you intend to charge the grove and endeavor
to capture the Pawnee warriors?” said Bill to
the Sioux chief.</p>

<p>Young Thunder smiled and shook his head.</p>

<p>“No, no,” he answered. “’Nough to get back our
ponies.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>

<p>The young scout thought that the Indians were not
such terrible fighters as some writers would have them
appear, and this impression never changed, although
he occasionally met a few that knew no fear.</p>

<p>Two of the Pawnee braves had been killed in this
little skirmish, and the warriors rode back to their
village carrying the fresh scalps tied on the end of
long sticks. The whole village turned out to greet
them, yelling like furies. Pandemonium reigned all
night, but when old trapper Williams heard that young
Bill had ridden in so close to the timber, he said:</p>

<p>“I shall have to keep you at home next time, if I
expect to return you to your parents. You are a
young fool to approach close to timber where hostile
Indians are concealed.”</p>

<p>“Three of our ponies were in the bunch of captured
horses,” answered the young scout. “I did
not wish to return without them. As for the Sioux,
I consider them a lot of cowards.”</p>

<p>The Pawnees had not acted with good judgment in
trying to drive off fully one hundred head of horses,
so near daylight. For they should have known that
the Sioux warriors would be after them, mounted
upon their best war-ponies.</p>

<p>The trappers soon bade good-by to their kind hosts
and continued on towards the Little Wind River,
crossing a rugged and romantic country, where lofty,
sky-piercing peaks ascended into the banks of drifting
clouds. To the northwest were the Wind River Mountains;
to the eastward was the Big Horn Range,&mdash;the
home of the buffalo, elk, antelope, deer, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
grizzly bear. It was a hunter’s paradise, where many
different tribes of Indians met on their annual hunt,
and often battled for the right to the soil. Hostile
war-parties were even now quite numerous in the
mountains. At Little Wind River, Evans and Russell
picked up a moccasin, showing that the redskins were
quite near.</p>

<p>Beaver and otter seemed to be plentiful, so the men
set their traps. At night they slept with arms at their
sides, ready for instant action, and a close guard was
stationed beyond camp, as it was almost certain that
the Indians would discover them and would run off
with their stock. This was the most dangerous country
on the plains and was constantly invaded by war-parties
of Blackfeet, Bloods, Piegans, and Crows.
All had to be constantly upon the alert to avoid losing
their horses and their scalps.</p>

<p>About four o’clock one morning two rifle reports
brought every man to his feet. Yell after yell sounded
from the darkness, and shot after shot came whistling
into the camp. In an instant the trappers were up
and about&mdash;their rifles replying to this fusillade.
Evans and Russell (two of the most experienced
scouts) killed a couple of the Indians with their first
shots, for dawn was just coming, and two black bodies
were seen to leap into the air and then roll down a
hill upon which they had been crouching. The savages
were shooting arrows and old Hudson Bay flintlocks
which made a big flash when discharged. As
the scouts aimed at these flaming jets, they must have
done considerable damage, for the Indians fell back.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
They continued to send shots into camp until day
dawned.</p>

<p>“Let’s charge the critters!” shouted young Bill
Hamilton.</p>

<p>“Not on your life, boy!” shouted trapper Williams.
“It’s most dangerous to run into such a number of
unknown redskins at night.”</p>

<p>So the young man desisted.</p>

<p>Just before daylight the Indians attempted to recover
their slain comrades, by crawling up to them
in the grass. The scouts, however, were up to such
tactics and added one more to keep company with
two of the red men already sent to the Happy Hunting
Grounds. At this, the redskins gave a yell of
deep despair. Then they filed slowly away, sending
a few parting shots at the trappers, just to show that
they were still in good fighting order.</p>

<p>Five of the trappers’ ponies had been badly
wounded, and Williams was so enraged at the injury
which had been done that he was determined to
punish the Indians still further. Leaving two men in
camp, he ordered the rest to follow him on the fresh
trail of the early morning marauders, which led up
a small stream. The scouts galloped eagerly forward,
and, coming to a rise, were soon within plain view
of the red men, who were hurrying along, trying to
get two of their wounded comrades to the protection
of a grove.</p>

<p>“Dash on to the right!” shouted Williams. “Head
the redskins off from that bunch of trees!”</p>

<p>The red men saw in a moment that they would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
be cut off from the grove, and they made for a patch
of willows and stunted box-elders just below them.
There were eleven of them in all and the trappers certainly
had them cornered.</p>

<p>It was about a hundred yards to the Indians, and
a scout named Dockett tried a shot at them. The red
men returned fire, wounding him in the thigh. There
were a quantity of boulders near by, and Williams
ordered his men to roll them up to the brow of the
hill, in order to form breastworks. Four of the trappers
were left behind this, while Williams told Noble
and young Bill Hamilton to follow him to the grove
without letting the Indians notice that they had decamped.</p>

<p>In the grove the trappers concealed themselves, and
the wisdom of their move was quite clear. The Indians
realized that they would all be shot down if
they remained in their present position, for the men
behind the brow of the hill now had their range. Six
of them made a dash for the cluster of trees.</p>

<p>When the scurrying red men were within one hundred
yards of the timber, Williams gave orders to
shoot. The trappers took careful aim, and, at the
flash of their rifles, three of the red men fell face
down. The other three gave a yell of despair and
ran up the hill. The trappers dashed after them, and
the Indians became panic-stricken when they saw the
mounted white men debouch from the thick woodland.</p>

<p>Williams raced onward, dashed right at the Indians,
and, although shot at, managed to bring both of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
redskins to the ground. Now all three had been
slain, and the revenge which the trappers had wished
for had been fully satisfied. The redskins were Blackfeet,
the most thieving class of wild riders of the
plains.</p>

<p>There were still five Indians in the willows. Many
men would have let them go. But not so with Williams.
He was considered the hardest man on the
plains to down in a fight with the Indians, for he was
never known to quit when once started. It was to
be a battle to the bitter end.</p>

<p>“There are five Indians down there who shot at
and insulted us,” said he. “They shall have what
they would have given us had they been successful in
their attack.” Here he turned to young Hamilton.
“Boy,” said he, “never let an Indian escape who has
once attacked you! I want you to go with me. We
will walk to the gulch and approach from below.”</p>

<p>But the trappers held their leader in too high estimation
to allow him to thus recklessly expose himself.</p>

<p>“Your orders are going to be disobeyed for once
in your life,” said they. “We cannot afford to lose
you.”</p>

<p>Williams smiled.</p>

<p>“Evans and I will undertake the job,” cried scout
Russell. “You cover us with your fire.”</p>

<p>In a second&mdash;and before Williams could answer&mdash;they
bounded into the gulch below. Both were
quick of foot and had been in so many desperate battles
that they understood the danger of approaching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
prostrate redskins; for a wounded Indian is an uncertain
animal.</p>

<p>The rest of the scouts kept up a steady fire until
Evans and Russell were seen to be close to the willows.
Then they ceased, as the two scouts bounded forward,
yelling like Indians. The other trappers also rushed
down, and although one of the braves had his arrow
in his bow&mdash;all ready to shoot&mdash;he never pulled it.
In a very short time it was all over.</p>

<p>The Indians had now been annihilated, and among
their effects were found two fine bridles, ammunition,
knives, and other articles belonging to trappers. It
was evident that some small body of white traders
had been surprised by these Blackfeet and put out
of the way forever. So ended this stiff little skirmish.</p>

<p>The trappers now kept on their way, set many
beaver traps, caught a great many of these animals;
and traded with several bands of friendly redskins.
The men were all fine shots and often received praise
from people for their expertness in fire-arms, but no
more than they merited, for an American mountaineer
had no equal on the globe. It was necessary that
the trappers should be very expert, for they carried
their lives in their hands, and were liable to come in
contact with roving war-parties at any moment. To
be taken prisoner meant torture and death, and it was
therefore impossible for an Indian to capture either
a scout or a trapper. They knew what would follow.</p>

<p>Young Hamilton thoroughly enjoyed the life and
soon became one of the most proficient talkers in sign<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
language on the plains. The trappers reached Fort
Bridger, where were many Shoshones, who asked the
youthful scout many questions by signs, all of which
he answered correctly. This astonished even the older
trappers, many of whom thought that he had been
raised by some tribe.</p>

<p>Williams now left the men of the plains in order
to go to Santa Fé on business, but promised to be
back in the spring and organize a new party for a
two-year expedition. Before he left he took young
Hamilton aside and gave him advice in many matters.
He looked upon him as a son, and few fathers ever
gave their children better counsel. The trappers decided
to trap near Salt Lake, and the Bear and Malade
Rivers, during the fall.</p>

<p>When they had proceeded for some distance they
were met by a party of Indians, who spoke the Shoshone
tongue, and who informed them that they had
to pay for going through their country. Perkins&mdash;who
was now leader of the trappers&mdash;tried to make
peace with them, but without success. He made the
Indians keep away, but they continued to make signs,
meaning “dogs,”&mdash;which the white men well understood.
The trappers held their rifles ready for any
emergency.</p>

<p>Perkins cautioned his men to have patience, and,
filling his pipe, offered it to the chief, who refused it
with contempt, saying: “Big chief never smokes
with white dogs.”</p>

<p>The head trapper’s patience was now almost exhausted
and he told the chief in plain language to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
“get out.” His men prepared for action, as he spoke,
so the redskins mounted their ponies and departed
towards the South. As they rode off, they cast all
kinds of insults at the white men, both with signs and
in spoken language. It was certain that they would
soon follow the trappers and then there would be a
big fight.</p>

<p>That night every precaution was taken to guard
against a surprise. Two guards were put on duty,
to be relieved at midnight, and a well fortified position
was chosen for camp. Perkins said that it was
customary for the Utahs to attack just before daylight,
for this is the time that the redskins expect to
find the whites fast asleep. This is what occurred in
the present instance.</p>

<p>A little before daylight two or three wolf howls
were heard by the guards, who immediately notified
Perkins. Soon all the men were up, their packs being
placed in a semi-circle as a breastwork. Twenty of
the best horses were saddled and tied in a thicket, to
protect them from Indian bullets and arrows. Defeat
meant death, so the trappers looked stolidly before
them, fully prepared for the worst, if it were to come.</p>

<p>The first wolf howls were soon followed by others,
coming from nearer points and in a semi-circle. Indians
are experts in imitating the cries of owls, wolves
and coyotes. So adept are they in the art that it is
difficult to distinguish them from the calls of real
birds and beasts. Few trappers can successfully imitate
these animals, although many endeavor to do so.</p>

<p>It was not long before the attack commenced. Just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
as day began to dawn the wolf howls ceased and the
trappers knew that the crisis was at hand. The Indians
had crept to within one hundred yards of camp
before they gave the war-whoop. Then they came
on&mdash;fully one hundred strong&mdash;yelping wildly. The
trappers were all ready with their rifles and pistols.
Three were armed with double-barrelled shot-guns,
loaded with half-ounce balls and fine buck-shot.</p>

<p>The Indians raced to within fifty yards before a
single trapper fired,&mdash;then all began to shoot. The
redskins halted. At this the plainsmen began with
their six-shooters, one in each hand, for&mdash;as a result
of long continued practice&mdash;they could shoot equally
well with either arm. These mountaineers had to be
experts in the use of both rifle and pistol, for inability
to fire with accuracy meant instant death upon many
an occasion.</p>

<p>The red men were much surprised to receive so
many shots from but twenty men. They became panic-stricken,
for they had not supposed that the trappers
possessed two pistols each&mdash;twelve shots apiece after
their rifles had been discharged. They had expected
to rush right over the breastworks, before the rifles
could be reloaded. They retreated&mdash;assisting many
of their wounded. An arrow went through young
Bill Hamilton’s cap.</p>

<p>The redskins had received a repulse which they had
not expected, and retreated to their villages, taking
their dead and wounded with them. The chief, Old
Bear, had been slain, as well as many of their bravest
warriors. This tribe had frequently robbed small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
parties of trappers, killing them many times and always
treating them with great cruelty. After this
fight they usually gave well-organized bodies of trappers
the “go by.”</p>

<p>The plainsmen finished their work without being
further molested, and then moved on to Bear River.
In the spring, trapper Williams returned from Santa
Fé, and made a proposition to the men that he should
form a company of forty-three and make a two-years’
trip. This was agreed upon, and the expedition soon
started, on the 25th of March, 1843. The trappers
were divided into four parties, which collected furs in
common; that is, each man had an equal share in
all furs caught by his own party. For mutual protection
they always pitched their tents and lodges
together.</p>

<p>They soon passed through the country inhabited by
the Bannock Indians. These were troublesome and
had many a brush with the stout men of the plains.
But the trappers came through every escapade without
much loss. The region in which they soon found
themselves was rich with beaver and otter; large
quantities of which were caught. It was a grandly
beautiful country&mdash;a paradise for all kinds of game.
Bear were particularly plentiful, and many a grizzly
and cinnamon fell before the accurate aim of the men
in buckskin.</p>

<p>“Young Bill” Hamilton could not be called
“Young Bill” any more, because he was a seasoned
trapper, and his many experiences with wild men and
wild beasts had made it possible for him to hold his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
own with the most experienced men of the party.
The trappers made a wide détour, first going far
North, then travelling South to the Carson River in
Nevada, where they lost one of their best and most
skilled men,&mdash;a fellow named Crawford. They were
in the Pah Ute country and could tell very readily
that the Indians were most unfriendly. In spite of
this they set their beaver traps, for they saw that these
animals were thick.</p>

<p>As Crawford did not return to camp one evening
it was decided to make a search for him. Dockett,
who was an outside trapper (or one who had his traps
furthest from camp), had seen the missing man setting
his traps at a bend in the river, at some distance
away. To this point the trappers hurried, and, scouting
in some cottonwood groves, in order to make sure
that there was no ambush, they went in and soon discovered
where one of their number had been at work.
Indian tracks were thick near by.</p>

<p>They saw where a horse had stood, and, going to
a thick bunch of willows, found the ground saturated
with blood. The Indians had lain hidden in this willow
patch, knowing that the trapper would come in
the morning to look after his traps. They had thrown
Crawford into the river, which was four feet deep.
He could be easily seen and was soon pulled to dry
land. Crawford was a handsome Texan, six feet tall,
brave, kind, generous, and well-educated. Five of
his traps were found, and four dead beaver. The
Indians had stolen what was left, including his rifle,
two pistols, and a horse. The trappers were soon back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
in camp with the body of their comrade, and, when
the men saw Crawford, it was plain that death would
be the penalty to any of the redskins who had waylaid
him. A grave was dug&mdash;the trapper was laid
to rest in his blankets&mdash;and no monument was placed
above to mark the spot, for fear that some wandering
redskin would dig up the remains of this fearless man
of the plains.</p>

<p>The Pah Utes were soon to be encountered, for
at two in the afternoon the pickets signalled: “Indians
coming on horseback.” The stock was corralled
and the scouts stood ready for action. The pickets
now rode in and reported sixty Indians, who made
their appearance upon a ridge, about three hundred
yards from camp.</p>

<p>“Come out and fight! Come out and fight!” yelled
the redskins.</p>

<p>Crawford’s death had cut the scouts down to thirty-eight,
but that did not worry these hardy souls. It
was impossible to keep the men back, so eager were
they to avenge the death of their comrade. Leaving
three trappers to take care of camp, the others mounted
and started away in the direction of the Indians.</p>

<p>When the redskins saw them coming they gave yell
after yell, thinking, no doubt, that this would paralyze
the white men with fear. Then they divided and
charged from two sides. The trappers let them get
to within one hundred yards, when they halted and
brought their rifles into play. Dropping these upon
the ground, they charged with pistols in hand. Fully
twenty-five Indians fell before their accurate shots.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
This bewildered the savages, and, before they could
recover, the scouts were in their midst.</p>

<p>One tall redskin was mounted on Crawford’s horse.
He tried to get away, but delayed entirely too long.
He was caught, knocked prostrate to the ground, and
the horse, rifle, and pistols of the dead scout were
recovered. Forty-three ponies were captured. Very
few of the Pah Utes made their escape. Poor Crawford,
you see, was thus revenged in full.</p>

<p>Two horses which the trappers rode were killed.
A few of the scouts received arrow wounds, but none
were serious. The secret of the frontiersmen’s success
was in making every shot count in the first volley.
This bewildered the Indians, and, before they could
collect their thoughts, the plainsmen were among them.
The scouts were an effective body, and were as well
drilled in the use of both rifle and pistol as the soldiers
of any nation. Their horses, too, were trained
to stand fire and to be quick in evolutions. The war-whoops
and yells of the Indians simply made them
prick up their ears and look unconcerned.</p>

<p>After this affair the little party received little molestation
from the red men. At a council it was decided
to move, as it was not known how many warriors
these Indians could muster, and it was not safe
for one or two men to go any distance from camp
after furs. The hardy adventurers travelled to the
Laramie River, where twenty-five of them determined
to go back to St. Louis and to take their furs with
them. The original thirteen all returned to the Far
West; Williams going to Santa Fé, accompanied by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
Perkins and six others. It was a sad parting for all,
particularly for Bill Hamilton, who had grown to
love his comrades like brothers.</p>

<p>Bill was now a seasoned trapper, and the rest of
his career on the plains was marked by many hazardous
adventures with the redskins. He went to California,
during the gold excitement, was in the famous
Modoc war of 1856, where he belonged to the “Buckskin
Rangers,” and was employed as a scout in the
uprising of the Sioux in 1876, which was so disastrous
to General Custer and his command. He was among
those who followed Crazy Horse to his end, and
finally resigned from the service of the Government to
resume the free and independent life of a trapper. At
eighty-two years of age he was living a peaceful and
contented life at Columbus, Montana, where&mdash;as he
says in his biography&mdash;“I am thankful that I can
still enjoy and appreciate the wonderful beauties of
nature.”</p>

<p>A true plainsman, a great shot, a nervy fighter,&mdash;such
was “Uncle Bill” Hamilton. At the present
time there is no wild and adventurous West to create
such characters as this, for bad Indians have passed
away forever.</p>

<h2 class="p4">UNCLE JOB WITHERSPOON:</h2>

<p class="pch">AND HIS EXCITING ADVENTURES WITH
THE BLACKFEET</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">NO more famous plainsman ever lived upon the
Wyoming prairies than Uncle Job Witherspoon:
a veteran of many an Indian battle:
of several tussles with grizzly bears; and of frequent
brushes with desperadoes and bad men who had taken
to the hills in order to escape jail. Born about 1830,
the old fellow was still hale and hearty in the year
1898, when he was piloting a number of young men
through the intricacies of the Rocky Mountains; a
region which he had lived in for many years.</p>

<p>“Well, youngsters,” said the veteran trapper to the
party of young fellows who were upon an amateur
hunting excursion, “when you’ve toted traps and peltries,
and fit Injuns as long as I have, you’ll sartainly
have considerable more experience than you have
now.”</p>

<p>The old fellow was sitting with his back against a
tree trunk, near the Grosventre River, and before him,
in a semi-circle, lay five young men. All looked up at
him eagerly, for they were in a country which had
once been peopled by hostile redskins. It was now
safe, for the savage tribesmen were upon reservations.
Still, the air of romance lay over the beautiful land<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
and added a zest to their expedition, which would
have been absent had they been in a more unhistoric
country.</p>

<p>“Ha! Ha! boys!” continued Uncle Job. “You
think that you’ll have a mighty nice time out on the
trapping grounds, and I ain’t going to say as how
you won’t. But, take my word for it, ye’ll wish yourselves
back in th’ settlements many a time afore you’ll
get there. What with fighting and hiding from Injuns
and them pesky grizzlies, and livin’ sometimes fer
weeks together on nothin’ but pine cones an’ such
trash as luck happened to throw in my way to keep
body an’ soul together, my time used to be anything
but ’specially agreeable, until I got used to it. Then
I found it barely endurable. It’s a hard life, anyway,
boys!”</p>

<p>“My, my, Uncle Job,” said one of the youngsters,
“why, then, do you go back to the plains?”</p>

<p>The trapper laughed.</p>

<p>“Well, there, boys, yer have me, anyhow,” he answered.
“Ter be right down honest with yer, <i>I likes
it</i>. It’s a fact, as sure as dry prairie grass will burn,
and I wouldn’t live a whole month in Saint Lewy (St.
Louis) fer all th’ money there if I could not be allowed
to spend th’ balance of my time in th’ mountain
country. I’m used to it, youngsters, and city air is
rank poison to me; besides, I’d spoil fer th’ want of
a fight with some of th’ red varmints of Blackfeet,
Pawnees, and Poncas; for, my boys, that’s the best
part of the life on th’ plains. And now,” continued
the old trapper, “I’ll tell yer about a fight, and a long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
battle it was, too, which I had with a party of them
cowardly Black feet over on the Sweet-water River.
It was something over twenty years ago, and one fall
when I was trapping on the headwaters of the
Columbia.”</p>

<p>The boys drew closer and gazed at the old fellow
with wide open eyes.</p>

<p>“We had about a dozen greenhorns at our post,
just like yourselves. We were only a few months
from the settlements and these fellows hadn’t yet got
toughened to the kind of a life we had to lead. Some
of ’em was about dyin’ with th’ ager, and we hadn’t
a dose of medicine, or even a blessed drop of spirits
to save ’em with. So, as I knew every inch of th’
country from th’ Pacific to Saint Lewy, I was ordered
by th’ head trader of th’ post to go to Fort Laramie
and bring back a supply of calomel, Queen Anne powders,
an’ sich truck fer our sick men.”</p>

<p>“You had your nerve with you,” interrupted one
of the boys.</p>

<p>“Always had plenty of that,” continued Uncle Job.
“The distance was about six hundred miles over the
mountains. We had come to the western side of the
range the spring before, by way of the Sweet-water
Valley Pass, and I concluded to take that route again
toward Laramie.</p>

<p>“Wall, things went well with me for some time.
After I got over the main ridge I kept along the south
side of th’ Wind River Mountain and stopped one day
on th’ Green River, in order to make me a new pair
of moccasins. The rough travelling over th’ hills had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
worn mine out and left me barefoot. While I was
stitching away at my shoes I remembered a <i>cache</i> (a
supply of provisions hidden or stowed away until it
should be convenient to remove them) which a party
of us had made the spring before about a day’s travel
out of my regular route. It was on the North Branch
of the Sweet-water River. We had started from the
head of the Platte on our way to the Columbia, with
a small drove of pack-mules loaded with provisions
for the new post, and when on the South Branch one
of th’ creeturs give out and we had to <i>cache</i> the cargo.
It was a package of jerked venison and a sack of
flour, with a small bag of rice for th’ sick, when we
had ’em, and a five gallon keg of hard cider. It is a
common practice with us trappers to <i>cache</i> our provisions
when we know they will be safe for some
future journey that way.</p>

<p>“Wall, as I worked at my moccasins, all at once I
got to be mighty thirsty, and a vision of that five
gallon keg of delicious cider began to come into my
head. Says I to myself, says I: ‘Job, wouldn’t you
like to have a little taste of that sweet beverage, ’specially
when nobody at the post would be either any
wiser or any poorer for it?’ I reckoned that I would.
So I finished sewing up my buckskin, an’ started next
morning, bright an’ early, for the <i>cache</i>. Now, as
I told yew all, it was one day’s journey from my
route, and it would take me another day to put me
on the right course again. That, you know, would
use up two days that I certainly ought to give to my
sick comrades at the post. But I argued this way to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
myself: ‘Now, I’m pesky thirsty fer a drink of that
sweet cider. I’m actually feelin’ bad fer th’ want uv
it. If I gratify my natural longing I’ll certainly feel
better arter it, and I can then tread out so much faster
that I shall more’n make up for th’ lost time.’ And
that’s the way that I reconciled it to my conscience.</p>

<p>“Wall, I reached the South Branch in th’ middle
of the afternoon, and going down the stream a little
ways from where I struck it, I found the cave where
we had <i>cached</i> our provisions. It was a pretty large
one, too. I crawled into the narrow mouth of it and
drew my rifle in arter me; and, as soon as my eyes
got kinder used tew th’ dim light, right up there in
the corner I found everything all right. There was
that jolly little red keg of cider, and it seemed to
actually laugh all over at the sight of an old friend.
And well it might, for it had been shut up there in
the dark for more’n six months with nothing but the
flour, the rice, and the dried meat to keep it company.</p>

<p>“I pulled out my sharp-pointed bowie knife and
tapped the head of th’ cider barrel in no time. But
just as I raised the little fellow to get a taste of him
I heard the tramping of horses’ feet outside, and the
howlin’ of twenty or thirty infernal Blackfeet. Gee
Whillikins! I had ter drop th’ keg before a bit of th’
amber liquid had wet my thirsty lips. Well was it
that I did so, for in that moment the entrance of the
place was darkened by a rascally Injun who had been
fool enough to follow me. Boys! I was plum
skeered!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span></p>

<p>“What was I to do? I raised my rifle and fired at
Mr. Redskin, who dropped dead upon the ground,
uttering a wild war-whoop as he fell. His comrades
crept into the mouth of the cave, seized him by the
feet, and gave a terrible yell when they found that
he’d been wiped out of existence. While they were
tugging away at the old fellow I busied myself in reloading
my rifle in order to get ready for the next
visitor. Although th’ pesky redskins kept up a terrible
hullabaloo they didn’t attempt to crawl into the cave
any more.</p>

<p>“Thinks I, ‘Now’s your time, old boy, if you ever
hope to have any refreshment.’ So, raising the little
cask of cider, I took a good, long, glorious drink. I
tell you, boys, that was delicious, for my throat was
all parched and dry from alkali dust. It braced me
right up and I’d hardly had it down my throat when
I felt that I was a host in myself and could handle,
single-handed, all of the Blackfeet west of the Mississippi.</p>

<p>“Arter a few moments three or four rifles were
cautiously poked into the hole, and were fired at
random into the cave toward me. I ducked to one
side, and let ’em peg away. They were only using
up their ammunition, an’ th’ sooner they got rid of
that the better it was for me.</p>

<p>“Next they sent a shower of arrows through the
opening, but with no better effect than with their
bullets. In the meanwhile I had found a little hole
through the rocks just large enough for the barrel of
my gun, and, watching a good chance, when the varmints<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
were thick about the mouth, I took good aim
and popped away at them. By the Jumping Jingoes!
boys, but I sent half an ounce of lead through the
bodies of no less than three of them at once. At this
th’ Injuns fell back, yelling vengeance, an’ I took
another refreshing pull at th’ cider. ‘For,’ says I to
myself, ‘Job, now it’s <i>your</i> treat, and here’s to as
good luck the next shot.’ But th’ varmints didn’t try
th’ shooting game any more, as they found that this
was a game which I could play as well as they, themselves.
Boys! I held all the trump cards! They kept
losing their hands, while I continued to hold my
own.</p>

<p>“Arter they had been quiet fer a considerable time
I poked my head out of the cave and peeped down the
stream, where I could see the cowardly wolves gathering
armsful of dry sticks and grass, which I at once
knew that they intended to bring up to the cavern
and smoke me out. I hadn’t thought of this before,
and, thinks I, the rascals have got me now, sure. I
can fight Injuns so long as my ammunition holds out,
but when it comes to a fire and smoke I ain’t a match
nohow for them fellers, shut up as I be in these here
limestone rocks.</p>

<p>“Presently th’ savages came back again to th’
mouth of th’ cave in such a direction that I couldn’t
bring old Kill-Deer to bear upon ’em, and piling up
their combustibles they set fire to ’em. The wind
happened to be blowing directly into th’ cave, and,
in a few moments, a nasty smudge began to suffocate
me. I had to crawl farther and farther into the place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
as the smoke followed me; and I could hear the Injuns
pilin’ on the grass and wood all the time. They
found that they couldn’t get me out by any other
means, and were now endeavorin’ to choke me to
death by their horrid smoke. Fortunately, as I
shrank away from it, I saw a little streak of daylight
ahead of me. It was a crevice in the rock through
which the rays of the setting sun were streaming, as
much as to say: ‘Be of good heart, Job; they cannot
smoke you out as long as you choose to breathe
through this nice little air hole.’</p>

<p>“I ran to the crevice, and laid down, breathing the
pure air, and laughing at the redskins, who were yelling
and dancing for joy at the cute trick they thought
that they were playing upon me. Luck was certainly
with me, boys, for through the crevice that admitted
the light and the air I discovered a nice little stream
trickling away, while a tiny pool of fresh water had
formed upon the floor of the cavern. Now, thought I,
if I only had the provisions with me, I could last until
the Injuns got tired and had to go away. So, holding
my breath, I crawled back again into the smoke, and
catching hold of the little keg of cider in one hand,
and a package of jerked meat in the other, I went
back to my breathing-hole and had a comfortable
supper. The red fiends outside were screeching and
yelling like mad men.</p>

<p>“Arter I had satisfied my hunger, and had taken
another pull at the delicious apple juice, I laid down
for a nap, for I knew that the Injuns wouldn’t trouble
me while they kept up their smoke.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span></p>

<p>“Wall, boys, I tell you that I had a pretty good
night’s rest, considerin’ that I had tew keep one eye
open. In the morning, after the smoke had settled,
I sat quietly at the side of the opening, expectin’ Mr.
Injun to creep through arter my scalp. They thought
that I had given up the ghost, and were all ready to
make a speedy end of me. But they had reckoned
without their host, for no sooner did a Blackfoot
show his head than pop! a little slug of lead from
Mister Kill-Deer made him remember that I was still
breathing.</p>

<p>“Them Injuns, I reckon, thought that they had
holed Old Nick himself, for they was plum surprised
when they heard the bark of my trusty old rifle.
When they saw another of their number fall, they
even forgot to yell. They found that smoke couldn’t
kill the old man, and so they tried another plan.
Their game was to starve me out. But here, boys, I
held the trump cards again. The fact was, they
hadn’t the least idea that the cave had been used as
a <i>cache</i>; and when they saw me take to it they thought
that I had discovered them and was hiding away
from them there. The old boys didn’t realize that I
had a store of good things piled up and ready for use.</p>

<p>“I could understand their gibberish well enough to
learn that they had determined to stand guard over
me until I should be forced to yield to starvation, at
least. But I had fully two months’ provisions in the
cave and that would hold out for some time. I determined,
therefore, to pass the time as agreeably as
possible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span></p>

<p>“I could hear that parties of Injuns rode away
from the place every morning, and others came to
take their place. They stood guard over me by turns.
At length, after four days, when they supposed that
I was about starved out to such a degree that I was
no longer dangerous to approach, a redskin poked
his head into the opening and began to crawl cautiously
into the cave. I was waiting for the fellow.</p>

<p>“Boys! I made a spring like a panther. It was
his life or mine, and my long knife did the work.
Presently another followed, and him I served as I
had the first one. Arter about a half an hour another
Injun put his head down into the hole and
called to his comrades. At this moment, I levelled
my rifle at him and let him have it. That morning,
my friends, I had wiped out three more of my
persecutors.</p>

<p>“They did not trouble me any for some days. I
think it must have been nigh onter a week, when,
making sure that I was dead from starvation, another
attempt was made to enter the cavern. I kept at a
distance until two of them had come in, when I sprang
upon them, and with old Kill-Deer and my knife,
made a finish of them also.</p>

<p>“Boys, th’ Injuns was now plum skeered. They
were sure that they had none but the Evil One to deal
with. In fact I blackened my face and looked out of
the cave at one fellow who had ventured near. He
gave an awful cry and ran away, howling. About
an hour afterwards, filling the air with their yells of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
disappointed vengeance, the whole outfit mounted
their mustangs, and I could hear them riding away
down the banks of the river.</p>

<p>“’O-o-o-e-e! O-o-o-e-e!’ they wailed; and, boys,
I sure did do some tall chuckling.</p>

<p>“Arter a while I felt sure that the coast was clear
of th’ red vermin. So I ventured into th’ open air,
and, mounting upon the top of a river bank, I could
see them spurring away across the prairie as if the
Evil Spirit were arter them. Boys! I had been pent
up in that dark hole for more than three weeks, as
near as I could guess; so the strong light of the sun
nearly blinded me at first. Arter a while I got used
to it. I tell you what, boys! if this green earth and
th’ blue skies ever looked beautiful to my eyes, they
did on that blessed morning when I crept outen that
living grave, for yer must remember that there wuz
dead Blackfeet all around me.”</p>

<p>“But, Uncle Job,” interrupted one of his hearers.
“How did your sick men at the post get along without
the medicine?”</p>

<p>The old trapper looked sad.</p>

<p>“Poorly! Poorly!” said he. “Two of them had
died before I returned. They waited for ten days for
me to come back, and, finding that I didn’t, they sent
another man to Fort Laramie for the medicine. The
others were saved.</p>

<p>“Arter an absence of about a month I reached the
post again. As I didn’t want to acknowledge that I
had turned out of my way merely for the sake of a
taste of some excellent cider while my comrades were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
suffering for the want of what I had been sent
for, I said nothing about it, beyond the fact that
I had been a prisoner among the Injuns and
had managed to make my escape arter a hard
fight.</p>

<p>“Some months arterwards, when a party of us
were trappin’ out on th’ Medicine Bow Range, we
concluded that we would make a visit to our <i>cache</i>.
We rode long and hard to reach there. Finally we
came in sight of the cave, and I recognized the place
where I had had a desperate battle for my life. We
entered the cavern and found it just as I had left it,
with the exception that the dead Blackfeet warriors
had been removed. The sack of flour and bag of rice
were just as the other party had <i>cached</i> them, and&mdash;not
greatly to my surprise&mdash;the gallant little cask of
cider had disappeared. The dried venison had also
vanished.”</p>

<p>The old trapper smiled benignly upon his listeners.
“The fact is, boys,” said he, “although I had a pretty
onlikely time of it with them cussed Blackfeet I felt
so awful ashamed of th’ hull affair that I didn’t let
on a single word about it. Th’ truth is, I wuz plum
angry with myself fer gettin’ caught in that ar cave
simply because I hankered after some sparkling
cider.”</p>

<p>At this all the boys burst into loud laughter, and
the old trapper retired to the fire in order to broil
some antelope steaks for supper.</p>

<p>“Fellers, he’s the real thing,” said one. “Too
bad that those good days aren’t with us now, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
then, we, too, might have some adventures of our
own.”</p>

<p>But the old times of roving Blackfeet, and desperate
battles for life and for liberty, had long passed
away.</p>

<h2 class="p4">HENRY SHANE:</h2>

<p class="pch">HEROIC SCOUT OF THE PLAINS
OF TEXAS</p>

<p class="drop-cap06">ONE day a young fellow was hunting deer
near Pinto Creek, twelve miles from Fort
Clark in Texas. His name was Henry
Shane, and, although a German by birth, he had early
emigrated to the Lone Star State, where he had
joined the United States army and had fought in the
more important battles of the Mexican War. Deer
were plentiful, and it was not long before he had
killed a fat buck. Laying his gun down upon the
ground, the youthful hunter took out his long knife
and prepared to skin the game.</p>

<p>Suddenly the sharp crack of a twig made him look
up. He shrank back with a cry, for before him were
six large and gaudily painted redskins. One had
seized his rifle, another pointed a gun at his breast.
It was useless to run.</p>

<p>“How! How! I surrender!” said the young
Texan. “You no hurt me.”</p>

<p>“Ugh! Ugh!” grunted one of the foremost red
men&mdash;evidently a chief. “We want you, paleface.”</p>

<p>The Indians now seized the unfortunate ranchman,
tied his arms behind his back, and&mdash;after whipping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
him severely with a pair of rope-hobbles, which they
used to confine their ponies&mdash;rode off with him.</p>

<p>“Oh, my,” thought poor Henry Shane, “they’ll fix
me now, sure. I’m afraid that it’s all up with
me!”</p>

<p>The redskins moved off quickly towards the northwest,
and had not gone very far before they were
joined by nine more Indians, making fifteen in all.
They travelled all that day and part of the night.
Then they stopped to rest and eat. Here they again
rained blows upon the back of poor Henry, but for
what reason he was at a loss to know, as he had done
nothing to warrant such treatment. For dinner they
presented him with a small piece of burned deer meat
with the hair still on it. The prisoner made a pretty
poor meal of such provender.</p>

<p>The braves took a good rest, and did not break
camp until dawn. Then they bundled up their goods
and were off. They travelled rapidly until about nine
o’clock in the morning, when they again made a halt
near a crystal spring. They had hurried along, for
they feared pursuit, and in this they were quite right,
for some Mexican herders had heard Shane’s gun
when he killed the deer. As he did not return, later,
they went in search of him, finding the slain deer and
a fresh Indian trail. “He is either killed or captured,”
they thought. “Probably the latter, as we
cannot find his body.” News was at once carried to
the fort, and a squad of soldiers was ordered to follow
the Indians. They were guided by an excellent
Mexican called “Old Roka,” who had lived with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
savages for many years and knew their methods of
fighting.</p>

<p>The Indians were camped near a cedar-brake, and
the blue-coats rode up, just as they had finished breakfast.
“Old Roka” led the soldiers into their very
midst, before they knew it. Even young Henry
Shane did not suspect the presence of the troops until
they were right among the redskins. The latter
picked up their own rifles and other arms. For a few
moments they had a lively fight with the blue-coats.
Bullets and arrows were flying thick and fast, when
young Henry decided to skip into the neighboring
cane-brake. He knew that it was a custom of the
Indians to kill their captives, when they were attacked,
so he decided to get away before they could harm him.</p>

<p>As Henry dashed away, an Indian fired an arrow
after him, which went through his arm and remained
fixed there. This did not stop the young pioneer.
He raced onward, and breaking off the handle of the
arrow, pulled it out,&mdash;then stopped and listened.
The fight was still going on, the Indians were yelling
and the carbines in the hands of the soldiers still continued
to pop. Some of the Indians seemed to be
endeavoring to make their escape into the cane-brake,
so the terrified Henry continued his flight, determined
to make his way back to the fort, without waiting for
the soldiers.</p>

<p>As young Shane made off, he saw four redskins
fall before the bullets of the troops. He pressed forward
and came to a wide creek which it was impossible
to cross. He followed it all day and, when night<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
came, climbed into a tree to spend the evening. A
mountain lion began to screech and call near by and
this kept him awake for some time. Finally he fell
into deep slumber.</p>

<p>When daylight came, the fleeing pioneer dropped
down from his perch and continued towards the fort.
This he eventually reached. He had been forty-eight
hours without food, except for the little piece of
burnt meat which the savages had given him. He
was very weak, and was welcomed like a long lost
brother. The soldiers had completely annihilated the
redskins, and, after the fight, had looked everywhere
for the young pioneer. As they could not find him
they had given him up for lost and had returned to
the fort. When they saw the lost frontiersman, they
gave three long cheers for the “young cuss who got
away. Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah!”</p>

<p>Not long after this exciting affair Henry Shane
settled upon a broad creek, called Chicon Creek, which
ran near the Anna Catchi Mountains. A few settlers
were near him and the Indians were quite numerous.
They were also very hostile to the whites, and the
young pioneer soon had a very serious affair with
them.</p>

<p>One day he was riding by the San Miguel ranch,
which was an old-time Mexican ranch with a rock
wall around it and an entrance through a gate. When
he arrived at this place he could see no one stirring.
The gate was open, so he dismounted and went in.
He saw no signs of life. A little dog barked at him,&mdash;that
was all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span></p>

<p>Upon a smooth piece of sheet-iron, which lay near
two rocks, were several cakes of bread. They had
been turned and were burned upon the under side.
As the fire still gleamed beneath them, the pioneer
was sure that something was wrong. He could see
no one,&mdash;so continued upon his way.</p>

<p>His horse trotted slowly along, and Henry soon
crossed a creek where he found a dead Mexican. It
was evident that the “Greaser” had been killed by
Indians, for his body was full of arrows, and near by
was his horse, lying motionless upon the ground.
The Mexican had been endeavoring to get to the
ranch when the Indians caught up with him. They
first killed his horse and then killed him.</p>

<p>Shane rode onward. As he came upon the top of
a ridge he saw a broncho tied some distance off. He
knew enough about Indians to keep well away from
the animal. So&mdash;riding around him&mdash;he continued
upon his journey. He soon saw the wisdom of his
move, for as he rode onward he beheld an Indian
crouching near his pony. Soon five others came into
view and started after him at a hard gallop.</p>

<p>The plainsman pushed rapidly along and came to
a ranch where there was a crowd of excited Mexicans,
some of whom were from the place where the dead
Mexican had been employed. The murdered vaquero,
they said, had been away from the ranch when it was
attacked. The Indians had headed him off and had
killed him, after he had made a run to get inside the
walls of the adobe house.</p>

<p>“We outnumber the infernal redskins,” cried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
Henry. “Come on, boys, let’s go back and clean ’em
up!”</p>

<p>“We’re with you!” cried the others, and, quickly
mounting their mustangs, they were soon started
towards the place where the Indians had last been
seen. As they rode over a small hillock, the murderous
redskins could be sighted far below on the plain.
They were intent upon setting fire to the ranch buildings
and did not notice the approach of Shane and his
companions.</p>

<p>“Spread out, boys!” cried the now excited plainsman.
“Spread out and try to surround the red
devils!”</p>

<p>The Mexicans and Texan vaqueros followed his
lead, and, circling about the red men, soon closed in
upon them from three sides. Rifles began to ring
out, and, with a wild yelping, the Indians started to
retreat. As they did so, Henry Shane waved his sombrero
in the air, and all raced after the red men, on
the dead gallop.</p>

<p>Now was a beautiful running fight. The Indians
could not aim at all well, from the backs of their
ponies. Their bullets went very wide. The whites,
on the other hand, shot two of the Indian mustangs;
and, although their owners fell to the ground, both
swung themselves to the backs of other ponies and
safely rode off, hanging to the waists of the riders.
Finally they all got away in a deep canyon, and ambuscaded
themselves so well behind rocks and boulders
that the plainsmen decided to withdraw. The
Indians had not hit a single white man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span></p>

<p>Soon after this event Henry Shane purchased
some sheep and took them up on the Foris River to
graze. He lived in a tent, with one companion. They
pitched their canvas behind a brush fence.</p>

<p>One night Henry was sitting with his back to this
fence, boiling some coffee, with no thought that any
redskins were within twenty miles of him. But at
this very moment several were prowling around his
camp and had noticed the position which he was in.
One of them&mdash;bolder than the rest&mdash;slipped up to
the opposite side of the fence with the intention of
poking his gun through the brush and shooting the
pioneer in the back. As he shoved the muzzle of his
gun through the dry twigs, he made so much noise
that the plainsman heard him. Turning to his Mexican
herder, Felipe Flores, he cried out:</p>

<p>“Felipe! What is that noise?”</p>

<p>“It is a rat,” replied Felipe. “I saw one running
through the brush.”</p>

<p>As he ceased speaking the Indian attempted to
shoot, but his gun snapped and hung fire. The frontiersman
heard the noise and jumped to his feet.
When he did so, the gun went off, as the Indian attempted
to jerk it back through the brush, and the
ball passed through Shane’s hat. The Indian ran
away, before the startled sheepman could seize a rifle
and shoot in return.</p>

<p>The frontiersman had certainly had a narrow escape,
and he determined in future to be more careful.
Next morning he rode to a neighboring ranch and
discovered that the Indians had been there and had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
carried off twenty-five horses. The ranchers were
anxious to get back their stock, so a force was immediately
raised to pursue the thieving redskins. They
rode out&mdash;thirteen in all&mdash;and soon overtook the
Indians upon the west branch of the river Neuces.
The redskins were in camp, but saw the white men
as they came up a mountain, and moved off in a great
hurry. With a wild shout, the plainsmen, vaqueros,
and Mexicans started to gallop after the red men, who
crowded through a gap in the mountains and ran
away, carrying the captured horses with them. But
their pursuers gained rapidly, and pressed the Indians
so close that they dropped seven head of the Adams
horses. These were quickly seized by the whites, who
followed up the fleeing redskins until their own mounts
were exhausted.</p>

<p>“Reckon we’ll have to give up,” said Henry Shane.
“Boys, there’s some good beef stewing at the Indian
camp. Let’s go back and get some!”</p>

<p>All turned towards the deserted Indian encampment,
and, when they arrived there, found some
shields and head-dresses which the Indians had left
in their flight. They then camped for the night.</p>

<p>Next morning Henry Shane was anxious to get
back home, as the scout was practically over. Saddling
up his broncho, he started out over the plain
accompanied by a Mexican named Leal, who was the
“boss” of a neighboring ranch. They travelled on
together for about two miles, when suddenly and very
unexpectedly they met a band of Indians in the road
driving a bunch of horses before them. When these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
saw the two ranchmen they turned their bronchos
away from the road, and kept on, without molesting
the whites.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Shane to his companion, “we should
go back and tell the other men that here is a chance
to fight Indians.”</p>

<p>“No,” answered Leal. “I’m going home. But
you can do as you wish.”</p>

<p>Shane bade the “boss” good-by and started for the
place which he had just left. The plainsmen were
still in camp at the bluff, but they had their horses
saddled and were preparing to mount just as the excited
Henry rode up.</p>

<p>“Boys!” he cried, “I’ve just met a band of Indians
with some stolen horses. You come along with me
and we’ll get these fellows, sure.”</p>

<p>“Lead on!” cried his men. “Lead on!”</p>

<p>They were anxious for a fight.</p>

<p>The ranchers were soon galloping forward, and it
was not long before they had overtaken the Indians,
who quickly started off, waving their blankets at the
captured horses in order to stampede them. Firing
commenced, and Shane had a piece shot from the horn
of his saddle. Two of the Indians were killed, but
their horses carried them into the brush. Finally the
redskins made a stand upon the top of a round
mountain, but as soon as the whites charged them
they ran. They left three saddled pintos behind
them.</p>

<p>The plainsmen made a rapid pursuit, and soon captured
thirty horses and seven mules. The red men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
seemed to give up all hope of ever defeating the
whites, and scurried off like so many rabbits. They
dodged behind boulders and sage-brush. So quickly
did their ponies get away that they were soon out of
sight. Henry Shane and his companions were well
satisfied with the day’s work and gave up the pursuit,
for their own mounts were badly winded.</p>

<p>Life upon the frontier of Texas in those days was
certainly exciting for any one engaged in the sheep
or cattle business. In spite of the continued danger
from redskins, Henry Shane did not give up his interest
in sheep. One of his brothers&mdash;named Constance&mdash;lived
with him and helped to herd the flock,
although he kept continually upon his guard and was
never without his rifle. He, himself, was soon to
have a narrow escape from death.</p>

<p>One morning Constance was about two hundred
yards from the house carefully watching a number
of sheep. He was sitting near the bank of a creek,
when he heard horses’ hoofs knocking the rocks under
the bluff. He stepped up to the edge of the bank and
looked over, expecting to see some cattlemen from a
neighboring ranch. To his surprise and dismay he
saw nine Indians, with the chief in the lead. They
were riding up the bank in an old cow trail.</p>

<p>Young Constance was too startled to move. He
stood there trembling, and allowed the redskins to
come right up to him. The chief had a heavy quirt
in his hand, with which he struck Shane a stinging
blow over the head and knocked him down. He then
dismounted and stripped him. The red men now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
gathered around their captive, making a great screeching
and howling.</p>

<p>Henry Shane saw the Indians collected in a group,
and, seizing his rifle, went to a corner of a fence to
watch them. He could not see his brother, and was
all prepared to fire, should the redskins make a move
in his own direction. The Indians saw him standing
there, and, shooting Constance with an arrow, they
rode away, yelping derisively.</p>

<p>Henry followed the redskins in order to see which
course they took, and then came back to camp, still
unaware that anything had happened to his brother.
The Indians had apparently determined to withdraw
entirely, which was fortunate for the lone sheep
herder. Constance finally crawled to his feet and came
back to the camp, declaring that there were eight
bucks and one squaw in the party and that the squaw
had shot him. He was grievously wounded,&mdash;so
grievously that every one who saw him said that he
would die. But he fooled them all and became perfectly
well again,&mdash;much to the joy of Henry, who
loved him dearly.</p>

<p>Exciting adventures were still in store for the
daring Henry Shane, who continued to herd his sheep
in this border country, in spite of the fact that the cruel
redskins were all around him. Not long after the
wounding of Constance, Henry went up the river,
which ran near his ranch, and entered the ranch-yard
of a sheepman called Joe Brown, who owned a sheep
vat and a furnace. The ranch was then vacant, as
Mr. Brown had moved to Uvalde and had told Shane<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
that he could use his vat and furnace for dipping sheep.
It was Henry’s intention to start a fire in the furnace
for the purpose of boiling tobacco, which was
used in dipping the sheep, to cure them of a disease
called “the scab,” or to prevent them from catching
this dread complaint.</p>

<p>A Mexican named Bernaldo was with the sheepman,
and rode forward in order to get some horses which
were in a small pasture not far distant. He soon came
back upon the dead run, whipping his horse furiously
with his hat.</p>

<p>“Hello, there! What’s the trouble?” shouted
Shane.</p>

<p>The Mexican was so excited that he passed on
without seeing or hearing the plainsman, although he
was not far from him as he raced recklessly by. He
was certainly well frightened at something.</p>

<p>Shane was not armed. This was unusual, as he
seldom left the house without a gun, because of the
possibility of an Indian attack. Hearing a great commotion
in the pasture, where the horses were, he
walked up to the fence only to see&mdash;to his dismay&mdash;that
there were seven Indians in the field after the
horses. They saw him at once and three of them left
the enclosure in order to give him chase.</p>

<p>The plainsman was in a tight position, but his courage
did not desert him at this crucial moment. As
luck would have it, he carried a long stick in his hand,
which he had used in order to punch the fire in the
furnace. He turned and ran, but the Indians were
upon the backs of their ponies and soon came very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
close to him. He pointed his stick at them, as if about
to shoot. Every redskin dodged and swung himself
upon the off side of his horse. “Ugh! Ugh! He
have shooting-stick!” cried one.</p>

<p>This gave the courageous frontiersman another opportunity
to run, and he made off as fast as his legs
would carry him. A man named Patterson had a
ranch near by and to this sheltering abode the plainsman
now bent his footsteps. The Indians were hot
on his trail and soon caught up with him, but he again
pointed his stick at them. They dodged, and this gave
him a second start, so that he reached the ranch-yard
and jumped over the fence into the cow-pen. Uttering
loud and vociferous cries, the Indians shot some
arrows at him, and then turned back in order to secure
the horses from the pasture. This they did and were
soon galloping away with them.</p>

<p>The pioneer climbed out of the cow-pen, ran up to
the ranch house, and called to the owner, who happened
to be there:</p>

<p>“Come on, Patterson. If you will assist me, we
will get back the horses.”</p>

<p>“I’m your man,” Patterson replied. “Here’s a
rifle of mine. I will take a six-shooter.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said Shane. “We’ll see if we cannot
do something to these crafty fellows. Come on!”</p>

<p>The two ranchmen soon met the Indians coming
down the road, driving the horses before them. The
valiant two stepped to one side in order to ambush
the red thieves, Shane hiding behind a large cactus
plant. As the foremost Indian came near, Shane took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
good aim at him, and pulled the trigger of his rifle.
But it refused to go off. The Indians heard the noise
and galloped away with their captured horses, while
the two ranchmen made after them. They, themselves,
were ambushed and had to ride hard in order to get
away from the redskins, who were reinforced by a
considerable band. After their retreat the plainsmen
again followed with additional numbers, but the Indians
were well ahead, and the pursuit had to be
abandoned.</p>

<p>In 1872 Mr. Shane decided to make a sheep camp
about two and a half miles from where he lived, so
drove down there in a wagon one morning, in order
to pitch a tent and fix things for the comfort of his
Mexican herder, who was off with a band of sheep.
The camp was beneath the fork of a live-oak tree.
The frontiersman left his wagon about a dozen yards
from where he was at work, and started to put a
small board between the forks of the live-oak, to serve
as a shelf. Two guns were in his wagon.</p>

<p>While thus occupied, he suddenly heard a wild war-whoop,
and found that he had been attacked by the
Indians. A redskin came up behind the wagon, on
horseback, and shot at the ranchman with a six-shooter,
the ball striking the right-hand fork of the
tree and knocking the bark into his face and eyes.
The pioneer turned, in order to get his guns out of
his wagon, and faced the levelled revolver of the savage.
He kept cool&mdash;in spite of this danger&mdash;and,
as he walked to the wagon, received two more shots
from the Indian. As the redskin was behind the conveyance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
his shots went high, passing over the head
of the frontiersman, who soon reached his wagon and
looked for his guns. The Comanche saw what the
white man was after, and, when he perceived that his
shots had failed to take effect, he wheeled his horse
and ran away. Shane seized a rifle and fired at him,
killing his horse when he did so. As the pinto rolled
upon the ground eight more Indians showed themselves
and began to charge the lone white man. The
gun which he had just discharged was a Mississippi
yager, and he had no more balls for it.</p>

<p>But the frontiersman had another weapon: a new,
single-shot Ballard rifle, and he only had two cartridges
for it; one in the gun and one in his pocket.
In leaving home that morning he had left his belt
behind, which was full of cartridges for the Ballard.
He was in a close place, but he had&mdash;as you know&mdash;been
in close places before, and he was determined
to make the best fight that he could. He resolved not
to waste a shot. Using his wagon as a breastwork
he awaited the onset of the Indians, and when they
came nearer he raised his gun and aimed at them.
The redskins dodged behind the prickly pear and
mesquite bushes, from which they opened fire, hitting
the wagon and the ground around it repeatedly.</p>

<p>Now occurred a lively battle. The frontiersman
had tied a fat mule about one hundred feet from the
wagon, where he could eat grass. A daring redskin
concluded to risk his chances and get the animal, so,
leaving the cover of the mesquite bushes, he advanced
across open ground in order to steal the unsuspecting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
beast. When Shane saw the Indian coming with his
knife ready to sever the rope which held the mule,
he determined to risk a crack at him. He was an
excellent shot, and he knew that he could kill the
Indian if he did not dodge too quickly. Taking a
quick but accurate aim, he fired. The Comanche brave
jumped high in the air, and then fell in a sheep trail
and lay there. The other Indians set up a terrible
howling when they saw that their companion had
been killed, and several of them ran quickly, seized
him by the hair and dragged him out of sight behind
the prickly pear bushes. The pioneer still crouched
low and waited for the Comanches to come on, but,
dreading to expose themselves to such marksmanship,
the Indians did not again show themselves.</p>

<p>Certainly things looked bad for Henry Shane, but
help was at hand. The Mexican attendant heard the
fight, and from the number of shots that were fired
supposed that his employer had been killed. He ran
to the ranch in order to inform Mrs. Shane of this
fact. The lady sent four Mexicans out to see if they
could not assist her husband. When they neared the
scene of action the Indians decamped, leaving their
dead comrade behind. The ranchers buried the Comanche
brave where he had fallen in the sheep trail.</p>

<p>When the lucky sheepman returned to his ranch
from the scene of this thrilling little battle he found
that a strange happening had come to pass. The
Mexican sheep-herder who had rushed home to warn
his wife that the Indians had surrounded him, was
found to be in a serious condition, through overexertion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
in carrying the news of Henry’s supposed
death. The poor fellow was in great pain, and, although
he was placed in a wagon and was carried to
San Antonio, where he could see the best physicians,
he died soon afterwards.</p>

<p>As for the gallant Shane, he continued to have
exciting adventures with the redskins, and, not long
after the lucky escape which I have just narrated,
had another brush with the roving Comanches. He
had made a sheep camp three miles from his house,
at a place called Long Hollow, and had his Mexican
herder with him. This was the faithful Felipe Flores.</p>

<p>Early one morning Shane heard rocks rattling in
the hollow below the camp, so he and Flores went out
a short distance in front in order to investigate the
matter. Felipe went slightly in advance, and to
Shane’s questioning as to what he saw, replied:</p>

<p>“It is Mr. Dilliard, whom we have been expecting
to help us hunt for some lost sheep.”</p>

<p>Shane kept on, but suddenly started back in dismay.
Ten Comanches were coming for him upon the dead
run.</p>

<p>In an instant the sheepman turned and hastened
to the tent in order to seize his rifle. The Indians
were right after him, and crowded Felipe so closely
that he ran backward towards the fire. As a Comanche
endeavored to thrust a lance into his body he
fell into the flames. When this occurred the Indians
opened fire upon Henry Shane, endeavoring to hit him
before he could get his gun. Several balls struck the
tent, but the Ranger was unscathed.</p>

<p class="vh"><a name="i373" id="i373">i373</a></p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-373.jpg" width="400" height="483"

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span></p>

<p>Now the plainsman seized his rifle, and, wheeling
around, fired at his enemies. They retreated at once
and dashed into the thick brush. As they scampered
away, two Indians on the same horse were seen to ride
behind a thick bunch of prickly pears, only one of
whom came out upon the other side.</p>

<p>“That second redskin is still behind the pears,”
said Flores. “He is waiting there in order to shoot
any one who may come out to look around.”</p>

<p>“I think that I’ll stir him up a bit,” said Shane,
and, aiming at the bunch of pears, he let drive. Sure
enough, he routed an Indian, who ran off, screeching
loudly. When the spot was afterwards examined a
bullet hole was seen in the pears. The redskin had
had a narrow escape.</p>

<p>This was not Henry’s last adventure with the redskins
by any means, for, about a month later he went
down the river, less than a mile from his ranch, to
a place called the “Indian Crossing.” There were
two Mexicans with him, who had a wagon and a pair
of mules. Their intention was to saw cypress logs in
order to make boards and shingles for a new ranch
house.</p>

<p>The plainsmen finished their work of loading logs
and were soon ready to return home. One of the
Mexicans, called Antonio, had a gun which had been
resighted. He wished to have Shane try it, and therefore
called out:</p>

<p>“Come here, Señor, and try my rifle. It can shoot
well I know, but I would like to have your opinion
of it. There is a tree which will make a good mark.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’m agreeable,” replied Henry, taking up the gun.
He fired two shots at the tree. When he had finished,
the Mexican went over to see where he had hit the
bark.</p>

<p>Over forty Indians were crossing the ford of the
river near by at about this moment. They heard the
rifle shots, and, learning from a scout that three white
men were there, determined to surround and capture
them. So they spread out like a fan in order to completely
annihilate the little party. Half of the redskins
came up on the bluff upon the east side, opposite
Shane and his two Mexicans; the balance went to the
old crossing above, so as to come around the frontiersmen
upon the west side and thus cut off their retreat
in both directions. Henry Shane was now in another
tight box. Let us see how he fared.</p>

<p>A sudden rattling of rocks warned the pioneer and
his companion that some one was near by. His friend
(the Mexican) mounted a stump, so that he could see
the crossing, and said:</p>

<p>“There are soldiers coming up the river.”</p>

<p>As he jumped down, Henry, himself, climbed up
on the stump in order to have a look.</p>

<p>“Soldiers!” he cried. “Why, man, those are
Indians!”</p>

<p>He immediately seized his rifle and stood prepared
for action.</p>

<p>Antonio, as you know, had gone to look at the bullet
marks upon a tree. When the Indians came down
the bank of the river they encountered this Mexican
and opened fire upon him. Antonio attempted to run<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
back to Shane, but, as he started forward, he was
struck by a bullet, and fell into some high weeds. The
Indians closed in upon the other two sheepmen, uttering
wild cries of delight, for they felt that they had
them, and they bore no love for Henry Shane. They
were armed with Spencer carbines and commenced a
rapid fire upon the bold frontiersman and his companion.</p>

<p>The bullets began to rain in from both sides of the
creek, as Shane took shelter behind a huge cypress
log and commenced the unequal battle. He was now
in the tightest place that he had ever been in in his
life, but he kept cool, and only fired at long intervals,
and with careful aim. The redskins were uncertain
as to the force they were attacking and were afraid
to come down into the bed of the river and to fight
at close quarters. The second Mexican crawled into
a tree-top, so that only his feet were visible. He was
of no assistance to the gallant frontiersman.</p>

<p>After shooting away for some time, the Indians
decided to send a warrior on horseback below (where
Shane was crouching), in order to see if all were
killed, or if there were any still left. The frontiersman
was on the alert, and, as the redskin approached,
he caught the first motion of the reeds as he slipped
through. The rest of the red men had ceased firing
and were all under cover.</p>

<p>There was a moment of breathless anxiety. Shane
held a large revolver in his hand, as he lay close to
the ground, watching around the end of the log, as
the fellow came in view. At once he aimed at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
redskin’s breast and pulled the trigger. The Comanche
reeled and fell to one side of his horse, clutching
the mane of the animal as it ran up a bluff. The
other redskins now rose from the grass and endeavored
to stop the startled beast; but he kept running
around in a circle, for some time, with the Indian
still hanging to his mane. At last he was captured,
and a loud wailing cry told the frontiersman that the
shot which he had fired had done its deadly work.</p>

<p>The Indians now held a council of war. They could
be easily seen by Shane, where he lay. Apparently
they had had sufficient fighting, for they mounted
and rode off. As they disappeared from view, the
happy frontiersman mounted a stump and counted
forty warriors. How many he had killed besides this
last one he could not tell. He took no time to investigate
the matter and prepared to leave at once.</p>

<p>The sides of the log, behind which he had lain,
were perforated with bullets. One bullet hole was in
his boot leg, one was in his hat, two were in his shirt,
three were in the wagon bed, and one of the mules was
badly wounded. In spite of this, the animal was able
to draw the wagon home with him, in which was
placed the wounded Antonio. The other Mexican had
crawled from his hiding-place after the fight was over.
He was certainly not made of the same stern stuff as
was Henry Shane.</p>

<p>The bold rancher and frontiersman had had a narrow
escape, but he had a still narrower escape, some
time later. It was upon a winter’s day, and he had
gone out to a place called “Griner’s Bottom” in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
order to listen to turkeys as they flew up to roost, for
he wished to kill some of them for dinner on Christmas
Eve. He found the place, and had not been
there long before he heard the sound of horses’ feet.
Looking around, he saw five Indians riding towards
him. They seemed to be unaware of his
presence.</p>

<p>There was no time for anything but quick action.
Henry hugged the live-oak tree, against which he had
been leaning. As he did so, the Indians came jogging
along on both sides of him: two on one side&mdash;three
on the other. It was rapidly getting dark, so they
did not see the lone frontiersman. Luckily they did
not look back after they had gone past. Had they
done so, they would have seen Henry pressing himself
flat against the tree trunk, grasping his muzzle-loading
shotgun very tightly and trying to keep his
teeth from chattering. Sometimes this antiquated
gun missed fire. Oh, fortunate Ranger! The redskins
were soon trotting onward in the darkness.</p>

<p>This was not the last adventure which the daring
Henry had with the savages by any means, but it was
the most exciting. He lived for many years upon his
ranch in Uvalde County; prospered, and became one
of the solid citizens of the state. Truly his was an
adventurous soul. It was to such men as these, who
dared to take any chance and assume any risk, that
the West owes its settlement, its civilization, and upbuilding.</p>

<p>All honor, then, to Henry Shane,&mdash;the Texan pioneer
for whom the Indian had no terrors. He passed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
through so many hairbreadth escapes that one would
think him often thankful that he was alive. Hail to
this stout German who helped to make history upon
the Mexican frontier!</p>

<h2 class="p4">POOR JERRY LANE:</h2>

<p class="pch">THE LOST TRAPPER OF WYOMING</p>

<p class="pc1">[<i>This is the story of a young frontiersman, whom I
knew, myself</i>]</p>

<p class="ls2">·········</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">JACKSON’S HOLE, Wyoming, was named after
one Jackson, a pioneer, explorer, ranchman, and
horseman. Jackson’s Hole was also the home of
horse thieves who, gathering up their captured steeds,
would run them into this peaceful valley to feed them
on the rich, natural hay until they could be driven
out at a different angle and sold to some one who knew
nothing of their former ownership. Jackson’s Hole
was also the home of desperadoes who had fled from
justice. Jackson’s Hole was the place that I was
going to in the summer of 1899.</p>

<p>“Goin’ to Jackson’s Hole, be yer?” said a fellow
in a big sombrero, on the train to Idaho Falls.
“Young man, you’ll never get out alive. Young man,
it’s a desperate place.”</p>

<p>He winked at me, shook his finger in my face, and
dropped back into the seat from which he had arisen.
“Young man,” he continued, “the Injuns will get
you, sure. Young man, look out!”</p>

<p>I confess that I felt somewhat disconcerted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’ll take care of my scalp,” said I.</p>

<p>Here the companion of my friend in the sombrero
spoke. This one had a red handkerchief knotted
about his tawny neck, and wore a corduroy waistcoat.</p>

<p>“Yes, son,” said he, “haven’t you heard about the
Injuns in Jackson’s Hole two years ago? They
stampeded th’ settlers, ran off a lot of stock, murdered
an’ burned, until rounded up by the U. S. Cavalry.
Reckon there be some more loose in thar now. An’
panthers! Why, boy, they’re as thick as peas in a
pod. An’ dangerous, too, by gravy!”</p>

<p>The first speaker guffawed.</p>

<p>“’Tain’t nawthin’ to th’ grizzlies,” said he. “They
be monstrous pestiferous. Why, they pull you from
your horse they be so unafraid of men.”</p>

<p>I squirmed uneasily in my seat, for I saw that they
knew me to be a tenderfoot.</p>

<p>“Boy, you’ll be eaten alive an’ scalped to boot,”
continued the fellow in the sombrero. “The good
Lord have mercy on your soul.”</p>

<p>“Amen!” echoed his companion.</p>

<p>And I wriggled again, for I saw that they knew me
to be an Easterner, and were having fun in their own
way.</p>

<p>At any rate, I was bound for Jackson’s Hole and
would get there somehow or other in spite of horse
thieves, “Injuns” and grizzly bears.</p>

<p>We met at Idaho Falls. When I say we, I mean
our party, for we were surveyors, bent upon exploration
of Uncle Sam’s possessions, and upon making<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
an accurate map of the somewhat unknown country
near Jackson’s Hole. We knew that it was a great
land for game and fish and that it was the home of
monster bands of elk, but we also knew that it had
an unsavory reputation as the haunt for “bad” men
of the hills. As I had come up on the train, certain
placards in the stations showed that these same “bad”
men were still around and had been operating at the
expense of the Express Companies.</p>

<p>The placards read:</p>

<p class="pcnar">“$40,000 REWARD</p>

<p class="pnar">For the Capture, Dead or Alive, of the
Men who robbed the Union Pacific
Express near Rawlins, Wyoming, on
the Evening of June 4th.”</p>

<p>Then followed an inaccurate description of those
who had been seen to enter the mail car, seize the box
containing valuable mail and expressage, and decamp
across the prairie with their plunder on their ponies’
backs.</p>

<p>At Pocatello, Idaho, I looked from the window and
saw beneath me a light-haired, blue-eyed Swede. He
was standing there nonchalantly, dressed in a corduroy
suit, blue handkerchief knotted about his neck,
and wide sombrero.</p>

<p>“That’s the sheriff,” said a man at my elbow.</p>

<p>“Where’s he bound?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Into the hills after the train robbers,” he answered.
“He has a <i>possé</i> with him and they ought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
to be able to capture a few of the bandits who held
up the Union Pacific Express.”</p>

<p>The train rolled on, but I always remembered that
sturdy little figure, standing carelessly on the platform,
in corduroys. In a week he had been ambushed,
with his entire <i>possé</i>, and two had escaped out of the
eleven. The little sheriff was buried in the hills.</p>

<p>To get into Jackson’s Hole was then a rather difficult
affair, for it meant a long journey by pack-train
from either Market Lake or Idaho Falls. But the
surveyor and the sons of the pioneer, whom he engaged
to pilot him, were not adverse to pushing into
a wild country. It took a week to outfit the party,
secure the necessary horses, engage the men, and whip
the fractious range-animals into some kind of submission
for carrying saddles, pack equipment, and
heavy bags of food and tenting. Then, in a cloud
of alkali dust, and with a crowd of Blackfeet children
gazing open-mouthed at the curious caravan, we were
off for the blue hills which lay to the northeast.</p>

<p>The plains of Idaho are not only arid and parched,
but they are covered with sage-brush, which emits a
strong, pungent odor that is delicious. The alkali dust
arises in clouds, and chokes one, as one proceeds, but
that is not the only difficulty, for&mdash;strange as it may
seem&mdash;the mosquito breeds by the millions in the
irrigating ditches, and had it not been for the thick
gauntlet gloves and netting attached to our sombreros,
we would have been fairly eaten alive by the black
swarms which followed us in clouds.</p>

<p>Every now and again&mdash;afar off on the prairie&mdash;we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
would see a whirling cloud of moving alkali
dust.</p>

<p>“Wild horses running to water,” said one of the
cowboys. “That’s the way they always go, on the
dead gallop.”</p>

<p>Occasionally we came near enough to see some of
them and they were lean, gaunt and rangy creatures,
which had escaped from the ranches, had run off to
the prairie and had found pleasure in the free and
untrammelled life of the plains. They would snort,
as we approached, throw their heads high in the air,
and then&mdash;turning around&mdash;would be off like the
wind.</p>

<p>As we rode along, hot, dusty, and thirsty, I heard
about Jerry Lane.</p>

<p>“This here Lane,” said Jack (a lean, little cowboy)
“is a Noo Yorker. He came out here three years
ago, sayin’ that life was too tame for him back East,
an’ he wanted to be right in the Rocky Mountains,
where the wolves, bears, and antelope could be seen,
just th’ same as in th’ time of Kit Carson an’ Bill
Bent. Some says that he’s a millionaire. Some says
that he isn’t. Leastways he has about all th’ money
one needs in this here country, an’ they tell me his
cabin in th’ Rockies is full of th’ best kind of rifles,
of steel traps, books, an’ all that’s nice.”</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">He found life too tame for him back East.</span>”</p>

<p>This sentence stuck in my mind and I knew&mdash;in
a moment&mdash;what kind of a youth was Jerry Lane.
He had the same spirit as the old explorers. He possessed
the imagination of a Lewis or a Clarke; a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
Champlain, or a La Salle. To him the spirit of the
wilderness was all absorbing, and, shaking off the
trammels of civilization, he loved to live out his days
amidst the towering mountains, which, even then,
stretched before us, jutting high from the sage-brush
plateau. I immediately felt a sympathetic interest for
Jerry Lane.</p>

<p>To cross into the valley of Jackson’s Hole requires
one’s utmost exertions, for one must climb up the
Teton Pass in order to get over the mountains which
surround this paradise of fish and game. For a man
and a horse to pass up and across is easy work, but
we were unfortunate enough to have a wagon with
us. As we neared the bottom of the trail, which led
almost perpendicularly up in the air, we saw a broken
vehicle of a pioneer.</p>

<p>“The Top of Teton Pass, or Bust,” some one had
written on a board and placed upon the battered
spokes.</p>

<p>It had “Busted.”</p>

<p>Now climbing, pushing, blowing, we yoked four
horses to our wagon and gradually worked it to the
summit of the Pass. It was July, but snow was on
the ridges, and the air was like Labrador as it swept
across the hemlock-covered mountains. When once
on top of the Pass, what a view! We gazed down
into a peaceful little vale with log houses and thatched
roofs, fields of green grass with stacks of yellow hay,
and bluish gray rivers curving gracefully across the
plain. Hereford cattle, with their brown bodies and
white faces, grazed contentedly upon the wide sweep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
of natural grass, and the barking of dogs sounded
indistinctly from the barnyard of a new-made
home.</p>

<p>Down we pushed into the valley, then onward,
across the Snake River at Moeners’ Ferry, and then
to the Buffalo Fork of the Grosventre. Antelope
began to appear upon the plain and danced about us
like yellow and white rubber balls. Two of the cowboys
dismounted and fired at them, resting their rifles
upon their knees. They could not duplicate the marksmanship
of Kit Carson or Buffalo Bill. Not an antelope
was even wounded.</p>

<p>We camped in a beautiful spot near the Grosventre
River, and, just as we were lighting the fire for supper,
a cry went up from some one:</p>

<p>“Elk! Elk!”</p>

<p>I was busy pouring some coffee, and, looking up,
saw a cowboy pointing to a high bank opposite our
camp. Sure enough, there stood a noble bull elk, his
spreading antlers standing out on either side, giving
him a calm and majestic appearance. He was gazing
curiously at the animated scene below.</p>

<p>Why is it that the average man’s first instinct when
he sees a wild animal is to kill it? I was satisfied
with watching this magnificent child of the forest,
but not so with the rest of the party. Three of them
ran immediately to get their rifles and a fusillade of
bullets soon whistled in the direction of the big elk.
He turned, galloped off into the timber, and left the
cowboys to bemoan their lack of ability with the shooting-iron.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span></p>

<p>“By gracious,” said one, “I can’t hit a barn door
at fifty yards!”</p>

<p>The elk was but one of the many which ranged the
Jackson Hole country and whose deep trails could be
seen on every hand. Their bleaching antlers, which
they had shed, were also upon many a hill, and frequently
we would pass a rancher’s cabin, where a
fence would have been constructed of the white twisted
horns of the old bulls. I knew that we would soon
see a quantity of elk, and we did.</p>

<p>Not many evenings later, as we were again boiling
our coffee for dinner, the most unearthly scream that
I have ever heard echoed from the canyon just to our
right. It was answered by another, and&mdash;if I can
make you believe it&mdash;the sound was as if a woman
were being strangled.</p>

<p>“Mountain lion screeching,” said Jack, with a grim
smile. “Awful noise, ain’t it?”</p>

<p>I confessed that it was.</p>

<p>“Makes me always feel skeery. Kind uv makes
th’ gooseflesh creep up my back. Heard ’em a thousand
times but always frightens me.”</p>

<p>The cowboy drew closer to the fire and I noticed
that he was shivering.</p>

<p>The mountain lion is a great coward and is afraid
to attack a human being. Unless cornered and extremely
hungry, he will not fight. He has&mdash;in spite
of this&mdash;the most unearthly scream, which would
make one believe that he was one of the fiercest and
most bloodthirsty of beasts. Welling up upon the
clear night air&mdash;in the very heart of the wilderness&mdash;it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
is enough to freeze one’s blood to hear their
wailings. It takes strong nerves to listen to their
gruesome noise without shaking.</p>

<p>I heard the lions again about a week later, when
I and a cowboy called Jim, were making our way up
the side of a beautiful little tributary to the Grosventre.
We were following a deep-rutted elk trail
which led up the edge of a mountain to and from
their summer feeding grounds, upon one of the higher
plateaus. There was a log cabin nestling at the foot
of the opposite hill&mdash;used by one of the game wardens&mdash;and,
in the rear of this, a deep bank of hemlocks
clothed the side of the cliff. Here the lions were
concealed, and, seeing us riding in the open, shrieked
out their defiance at the trespassers upon their demesne.</p>

<p>Although a startling and nerve-racking sound, we
kept upon our way, and I confess that I looked to the
shells in my rifle&mdash;fearing that one of the screechers
might consider us excellent bait for their dinner.
Soon we had advanced far up the canyon and then
the lions ceased their caterwauling.</p>

<p>We were now in the heart of gameland. The tracks
of bear were extraordinarily thick, and every now
and again we would come to fresh sign, not an hour
old. Once I reached a stream through which a big
grizzly must have just passed, for the water was still
muddy, and the print of his feet could easily be seen
in the soft bank. In spite of their apparent numbers
we could not even catch a glimpse of one of them,
and, although I was constantly hoping to meet with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
a specimen of these monsters of the glen, I was never
to catch even a fleeting glimpse of one.</p>

<p>Not so with the rest of the party. Not a week later
one of the cowboys rode into camp with a wild yelping,
and there&mdash;behind him&mdash;were two of his companions,
lugging in the body of a brown bear. He
was a little fellow and his fur was all rubbed away
in places, where he had scratched himself against the
rocks. In spite of this he was good eating and his
haunches were enjoyed by most of the party. Personally,
I did not care for the meat and preferred
canned tongue.</p>

<p>The elk trails were most abundant, and I knew that
we would soon see these brown deer, for we gradually
moved up to the summit of the Rockies, where were
vast plateaus covered with millions of beautiful flowers.
These the noble animals lived upon in summer
and slept among them too, for I would often find
round holes in the grass, where some of them had
bedded down a short time before. One evening two
of the horse-wranglers returned to camp with the
haunch of a cow elk, and stated&mdash;with much glee&mdash;that
they had run upon a band of six, coming through
some fallen timber. Two had fallen before their
rifles, and, after cutting off enough for the use of our
camp, they had placed the bodies in a position that
could be easily approached, at a later date, when bear
would undoubtedly be feeding upon the venison.</p>

<p>A week later we had a glorious view of a large herd
of elk.</p>

<p>While traversing a high belt of timber my companion&mdash;a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
surveyor&mdash;called out to me to hurry over
and see something on the other extremity of the ridge,
upon which he had just taken his position. When I
reached his side I saw that he was looking in the direction
of a high plateau, upon which fully a thousand
elk were feeding. No bulls seemed to be there&mdash;they
were all cows and calves&mdash;and were grazing like a
herd of cattle. The little calves were butting at each
other and frisking about in great glee, while their
fond mammas watched them with loving and tender
glances of affection. It was a beautiful and moving
vista.</p>

<p>My companion had a field-glass, and we stood
watching the changing mass of elk for at least an hour.
They apparently had no knowledge of our presence,
for the wind was blowing from them to us, so that no
strange “scent of the trespassing man” came to their
keen nostrils. There&mdash;in that beautiful mountain
pasture&mdash;the baby elk were growing to maturity,&mdash;while
far below in the valley the settlers were gathering
the natural hay which usually fed them, for
the use of their own cattle during the long and cruel
winter. There would be much suffering and distress
among the band, when they had left these mountain
meadows for the valley.</p>

<p>A week later we met the trapper and plainsman:
Jerry Lane. I had already come upon his cabin and
had stopped there for luncheon, leaving a neat piece
of paper on the door to the effect that,&mdash;</p>

<p>“Pardner, we used your tin plates, spoons, knives,
and one can of potted tongue.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span></p>

<p>High up in the hills the little log hut was situated
near a stream of icy water. It was about sixteen by
twenty feet, the floor covered with bear and wolf
skins, and four rifles in the rack. Great steel traps
hung upon the walls outside, and antelope hides were
tacked against it. There were good books within:
stories of hunting and adventure,&mdash;and upon the
floor&mdash;were numerous copies of the Sunday <i>New
York Journal</i>. Jerry Lane had lived well upon the
summit of the Rockies.</p>

<p>I will never forget the view of the young trapper
which came to me that morning. All around were the
towering Rockies: an occasional fleck of snow upon
the brown surface of the high cliffs; a gushing stream
over on the right; the sage-brush plateau stretched
away on every side, brown, bare, parched. A puff of
dust first appeared in the far distance, then two figures
rode up on horseback. They drew nearer and nearer.
In front was the youthful personification of Buffalo
Bill. It was Jerry Lane.</p>

<p>He was riding a magnificent half-bred animal&mdash;a
roan. His bridle and saddle, as I remember&mdash;were
silver mounted. A big pair of Mexican spurs were
on his heels. With a close-fitting suit of tawny buckskin,
a wide sombrero, cartridge-belt around the waist,
and a long rifle hung neatly under the left leg he was
a perfect picture of a plainsman,&mdash;such a picture as
one sees in dime novels.</p>

<p>Behind him was an evil-looking customer, dressed
in a slovenly manner, and scowling beneath a rather
battered-in slouch hat. His horse, too, had nowhere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
near the breeding of the other. He frowned as he
approached: the other smiled.</p>

<p>“Hello!” said Jerry Lane. “Dusty, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“You bet,” said I. “Where you bound?”</p>

<p>“Montana.”</p>

<p>“Hunting?”</p>

<p>“No, just taking life easy.”</p>

<p>That was all the conversation that we had. He
waved his hat to me, touched the spurs to his horse’s
flanks, and was soon off down the divide. For a long
time I stood and gazed after the lithe figure: young,
beautiful, brimming over with health and exuberance,&mdash;the
man who had found New York too tame for
his hot blood. Could you blame him?</p>

<p>Three days later a cow-puncher rode into our camp,
threw his saddle on the ground, hobbled his pony, and
drew near the mess table.</p>

<p>“Too bad about Jerry, warn’t it?” said he, as he
seated himself.</p>

<p>“Why, what’s the matter with him?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Shot.”</p>

<p>“W-h-a-a-t!”</p>

<p>“Yes, got into a row over the Montana line. They
say it was accidental. Some one dropped his six-shooter
on the floor. It exploded. No more Jerry
Lane.”</p>

<p class="ls2">·········</p>

<p>That night I walked out to a lonely rock and gazed
at the brilliant stars. It was the true West, after all,
the West that I had always read about but had never
seen until now. I thought of the sandy-haired, blue-eyed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
sheriff who had gone to the Great Beyond. I
thought of poor Jerry Lane: that lithe, active figure
in buckskins; that devil-may-care manner; that fresh,
pink-cheeked face. Yes, the West still held her tragedies,
and the low wail of a coyote far off on the plain
sounded ominously dreary, while the hand of death
lay over the great wild wastes of the rolling, sagebrush-covered
prairie.</p>

<h2 class="p4">THE SONG OF THE MOOSE</h2>

<p class="ppn2 p2"><i>This the song which the trapper heard,</i></p>
<p class="ppn3"><i>Heard in the gloom of the forest dark,</i></p>
<p class="ppn2"><i>Heard while the embers snapped and snarled,</i></p>
<p class="ppn3"><i>To the growl and glare of the glimmering spark.</i></p>
<p class="ppn2"><i>Heard while the lucivee cried from the pines,</i></p>
<p class="ppn3"><i>And the ribboned splash of a startled loon,</i></p>
<p class="ppn2"><i>Crystalled the rim of the lake, as it lay</i></p>
<p class="ppn3"><i>Soft in the gleam of the hunter’s moon.</i></p>
<p class="ppn6"><i>This is the song of the moose.</i></p>

<p class="ppn2 p1">Near the amber drip of the torrent’s rip,</p>
<p class="ppn3">Where the lean wolf howls at the blinding spray,</p>
<p class="ppn2">Where the sleeted pine is riven and rent,</p>
<p class="ppn3">By stress and strain of the mist-bank gray;</p>

<p class="ppn2">And the otter mewed to its hungry brood,</p>
<p class="ppn3">As the osprey peered from the hemlock’s crown.</p>

<p class="ppn2 p1">Our moosling day was a rapturous play,</p>
<p class="ppn3">We browsed where the partridge drummed a song,</p>
<p class="ppn2">Where the brown bear hid in the tamarack,</p>
<p class="ppn3">Where the days were short and the nights were long.</p>
<p class="ppn2">We roamed ’neath the arch of the drowsy larch,</p>
<p class="ppn3">Where the beaver bred in the inky pool,</p>
<p class="ppn2">We splashed in the foam of the cataract,</p>
<p class="ppn3">In the frothing spume and the ripples cool.</p>

<p class="ppn2 p1"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>We hid ’neath the pine of the Serpentine,</p>
<p class="ppn3">As the red fox barked to his sleek-fed mate;</p>
<p class="ppn2">We ate of the birch of the Restigouche,</p>
<p class="ppn3">Where the goldfinch whisper and undulate.</p>
<p class="ppn2">Oh, bright were the days, with surcease of care,</p>
<p class="ppn3">As we fed and grew from our clumsy birth;</p>
<p class="ppn2">While the woods were green with a shimmering sheen,</p>
<p class="ppn3">And the sun shone hot on the moss-grown earth.</p>

<p class="ppn2 p1">Then came the prod from the fleet-flying squad,</p>
<p class="ppn3">As the gray goose sped to the Chesapeake;</p>
<p class="ppn2">The leaves grew sere at the slow, dying year,</p>
<p class="ppn3">And the salmon raced from their spawning creek.</p>
<p class="ppn2">Our mothers fled from our marsh-sunken bed,</p>
<p class="ppn3">We browsed no more on the soft lilies’ pad;</p>
<p class="ppn2">From the distant blue came the caribou,</p>
<p class="ppn3">Rank upon rank&mdash;and their temper was bad.</p>

<p class="ppn2 p1">Their eyes were bad, as they fought for our feed,</p>
<p class="ppn3">When the air grew chill in the Northern blast,</p>
<p class="ppn2">And the white flakes fell from the sodden sky,</p>
<p class="ppn3">On the sleeted lakes, soon frozen hard fast.</p>
<p class="ppn2">Pure white was the cowl of the arctic owl,</p>
<p class="ppn3">And soft was his voice from the cedar deep;</p>
<p class="ppn2">As we ploughed our yard ’neath the mountain’s guard,</p>
<p class="ppn3">And marked our birch for the long winter’s keep.</p>

<p class="ppn2 p1">Now, sharp came the clang, as the wood-axe rang,</p>
<p class="ppn3">“’Tis man,” said our kin, “you must wander afar</p>
<p class="ppn2">From the sound of his voice and reach of his arm,</p>
<p class="ppn3">For his song is death and his hand is war.”</p>
<p class="ppn2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>The blue wisps curled from the lone logger’s hut,</p>
<p class="ppn3">Far down in the depths of the silent wood;</p>
<p class="ppn2">And shouts came loud from the boisterous crowd,</p>
<p class="ppn3">As they sapped the strength of the forest’s blood.</p>

<p class="ppn2 p1">We were taught to fend, with a lunge and bend,</p>
<p class="ppn3">The spring of the lynx, with his snarling yelp;</p>
<p class="ppn2">We were shown to ride, with a single stride,</p>
<p class="ppn3">The charge of the wolf and his whining whelp.</p>
<p class="ppn2">We saw how to strip the birch with our lip,</p>
<p class="ppn3">And to trample the shoots with our fore-leg weight;</p>
<p class="ppn2">We learned how to tell a foe by the smell,</p>
<p class="ppn3">That law in the wood was the law of hate.</p>

<p class="ppn2 p1">Another year, and the wide ridge was clear,</p>
<p class="ppn3">As the snow grew less, and the day grew long;</p>
<p class="ppn2">With a start of the sap we swung from our trap,</p>
<p class="ppn3">While the chickadee whispered his mating song;</p>
<p class="ppn2">And the robin came, with feathers of flame,</p>
<p class="ppn3">To carol a psalm from the budding spray,</p>
<p class="ppn2">While the chewink’s flute, like a minstrel’s lute,</p>
<p class="ppn3">Trilled clear in the balm of the softening day.</p>

<p class="ppn2 p1">Oh, that life was good in the opening wood,</p>
<p class="ppn3">As our brothers’ horns turned velvet to bone,</p>
<p class="ppn2">We wandered at will over hummock and hill,</p>
<p class="ppn3">’Till we found out&mdash;alas&mdash;we were never alone.</p>
<p class="ppn2">Man found us there, in our deep, forest lair,</p>
<p class="ppn3">And plunge as we would in the thicket’s gloom,</p>
<p class="ppn2">We ran on his track and the sign of his pack,</p>
<p class="ppn3">As he close hunted us down to our doom.</p>

<p class="ppn2 p1"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>There, oft in the dark, we trembled to hark</p>
<p class="ppn3">To his muffled call, by bank of the pond,</p>
<p class="ppn2">And to those who lacked in spirit of fear,</p>
<p class="ppn3">It was death to inquire, and death to respond.</p>
<p class="ppn2">Oft have we trod on the ranks of the slain,</p>
<p class="ppn3">As prostrate they lay near some crystal stream</p>
<p class="ppn2">Lured to their end by the low, soothing cry,</p>
<p class="ppn3">Mocking the mate of a love-longing dream.</p>

<p class="ppn2 p1">To the whispering rest of the trackless West,</p>
<p class="ppn3">We travel to live where the range-land is clear,</p>
<p class="ppn2">Where wolf and bear keep their sheltering lair,</p>
<p class="ppn3">Where silence is deep and man is not near.</p>
<p class="ppn2">Few&mdash;few are there left from merciless war,</p>
<p class="ppn3">Waged on our ranks, now broken and gone,</p>
<p class="ppn2">Yet, struggle we must ’gainst slaughtering lust,</p>
<p class="ppn3">Our end is in view&mdash;race-driven, forlorn.</p>

<p class="ppn2 p1"><i>This is the song which the trapper heard,</i></p>
<p class="ppn3"><i>Heard in the gloom of the forest dark,</i></p>
<p class="ppn3"><i>Heard of an ancient and vanishing race,</i></p>
<p class="ppn3"><i>By the growl and glare of the glimmering spark.</i></p>
<p class="ppn3"><i>Heard of the mannish blood-lust and greed,</i></p>
<p class="ppn3"><i>Of the withering waste in the rifle’s path,</i></p>
<p class="ppn3"><i>Song of the steel-clad bullet’s speed,</i></p>
<p class="ppn3"><i>This is the song of the moose.</i></p>

<p class="drop-cap04">NO longer moves the wagon train through clouds of rolling dust,</p>
<p class="pind2">No longer speaks the musket, foul caked with yellow rust,</p>
<p class="pind2">Wild days have passed; the yelping brave has vanished in the mists of time,</p>
<p class="pind">Wild fights are o’er, the valiant scout has ceased to cheer the firing line.</p>
<p class="pind">The brutish bison herds are gone&mdash;the lean coyote sneaks here and there,</p>
<p class="pind">Where once the pronghorn fed in peace, and shyly roamed the grizzly bear.</p>
<p class="pind">The elk are dead&mdash;the puma, too, no longer shrieks his wailing cry,</p>
<p class="pind">Where trapper’s fires are blazing clear, and sharply light the dark’ning sky.</p>
<p class="pind">From out the past, pale forms arise, the shapes of those who fought and bled</p>
<p class="pind">On treeless plains of alkali, and bravely found a gory bed.</p>
<p class="pind">The ghostly shapes go riding past; scout, voyageur, and priest,</p>
<p class="pind">Chief, warrior, and squaw, who gathered at the trader’s feast.</p>
<p class="pind">No more their laughter echoes loud, no more their voices rise and fall,</p>

<p class="pind">As&mdash;gathering for the dance of death&mdash;they held high revelry ’till dawn.</p>
<p class="pind">We gaze upon the written page, we marvel that such tales are truth,</p>
<p class="pind">Of fighting fierce, of wrangling rude, of scalp-dance and the cries of youth.</p>
<p class="pind">Then thankfully we tread the paths, which voyageur and trapper bold</p>
<p class="pind">Were wont to tread in olden times, when passions fierce were uncontrolled.</p>
<p class="pind">Yes&mdash;blood was shed&mdash;yes&mdash;men were brave, who conquered and who won the West,</p>
<p class="pind">Now there is love where once was strife&mdash;the scouts have reached their Heavenly rest.</p>
